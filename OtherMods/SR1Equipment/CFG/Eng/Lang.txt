Despite the exact repetition of the design from three hundred years ago, the ship is technically completely modern. The ship's armor is supplemented with acryn elements, which increases its cost. It is known that humans love luxury, so the ship is decorated with mahogany material inside, and there is also a cozy Jacuzzi onboard, where the pilot can relax after his space adventures. An ideal choice for a humanoid who is not indifferent to the history of humanity.</color>

Exactly because of that one high-standing lyakusha ordered development of his own hull on this particular archaic basis. Visual design got to be almost the same, but most of internal functionality were made with modern standarts, even cutting edge technology was used - acryning. Unforunately, someone from lyakusha's nearest entourage decided that hull was too good exclusive for him and leaked blueprints to public.</color>

They explain this by the fact that, from a technical point of view, the old hulls may still have undeveloped potential. After much scientific debate, where respected dalani painted ten-story formulas on holographic boards while their opponents slapped themselves in the face, not everyone was convinced, although history connoisseurs were still delighted. From modern buildings, these differ not only in lighter color, but also in interior decoration. Otherwise, the differences are minimal, including efficiency and strength.</color>

However, scientists managed to breathe a new life into the old models, changing most of the details and thereby significantly increasing the power of rare samples. The introduction of acryn technology has opened up even more opportunities for the use of this technique.</color>

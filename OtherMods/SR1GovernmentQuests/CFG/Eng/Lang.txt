We have already held a presentation ceremony, and now a similar event will be held on planet <ToPlanet> (the system of <ToStar>).
            Start=They now have everything ready, but they need a tape with the anthem delivered. This is what we want you to do, <Player>. You should deliver the tape as fast as possible. If you undertake to deliver the tape in <Day> days, you will receive <Money> cr on arrival.

But unfortunately we cannot trust anyone and so we regretfully have to literally cover their government buildings with our bugs. Gaalians are ingenious guys and constantly scan their premises and remove our detectors. To cut a long story short: on <ToPlanet> in the system of <ToStar> their counterintelligence has managed to uncover and arrest our Gaalian resident who pressed by their interrogators told them the location of our bug cache.

            Start=We are quite interested in this device and have studied it closely. Humans call this object "a smoking pipe" and it serves to conclude peace agreements. However, humans greatly overestimate its functionality. In fact, our experiments have shown how useless it is and we have decided to improve it. Our experts in mental brain diagnostics have designed an additional device that will ensure the mental equilibrium of negotiating parties. The device is installed into the pipe and now it will work for at least 500 years. We are pleased to return a fully functioning device to its owner.

He brought a valuable item from his personal collection to be displayed at our exhibition, a genuine 14th century Damascus sword. To our deep regret the sword was stolen from the exhibition, we searched in vain, so Professor O'Sakk got the insurance money and departed. But three days ago our services finally managed to recover the sword, and now we would like you to return it to its owner. It is a very valuable item, so we will insure it while it's in transit, till <Date>. Is this acceptable to you?

It looks like you've been cursed by the Challis after all. Too bad. You will certainly be killed very soon. Well, maybe at least this <Money> cr will cheer you up.

            Start=Dear <Player>, you can do us a favour. Recently a well known shaman from <ToPlanet> (the system of <ToStar>) came to us to read a series of lectures in cybermnemonics, telepathy and advanced curses. Then, he accidentally (please believe us) left behind his Challis. We have just found it, again accidentally (yes, it really WAS an accident), and now we would like to return it to it's owner. It is an ancient and extremely valuable object. If you fail to deliver it before <Date>, we will regard you as a thief; anyway prolonged contact with the thing will certainly be harmful to your bioenergetic substance. You certainly don't want a curse put on you, do you?

            Start=A terrible disease is ravaging the planet <ToPlanet> in the system of <ToStar>. Our laboratories have designed a virus which will aggravate it even further! As a representative of the most progressive brotherhood in space you can complete this dirty business by delivering the germs to our human colleagues. You might think it's unethical, but then life's like that and what would it be without genetic experiments in survival? Besides, you can only get good money for doing evil things.
            Start=The more days you need to complete the mission, the better container we need to deliver the germs. In this container, for instance, they will only live for <Day> days, and after that its contents won't be worth even a single poisonous Ragobamian toad. Taking into account the value of the container, your profit will be <Money> cr.

And we can see you are not at all like the Pelengs since you've had enough courage to face us. Here, take <Money> cr for your cheek.

            Start=We've collected some sensitive information concerning one of the Maloqi officials and now we feel the time is right to use it. You need to deliver this recording to the planet of <ToPlanet> in the system of <ToStar> and give it to a local government representative. Are you ready to help us, <Player>? If you like us and share our goals, you will certainly assist us with all your heart in what some would call blackmail, but we prefer the word "business" as it's more politically correct. Let's now discuss the timeframe, since we need to contact the authorities on that planet and inform them of our plans. Is <Date> all right with you? If so, we will call them with our demands straight away. And you can take off immediately. It is quite possible that the Maloqs won't kill you. As far as we can tell from their weird behaviour, they might even admire your courage.

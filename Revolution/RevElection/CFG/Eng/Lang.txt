Destroy it, <Player>!<br>No, stop, find out better where their headquarters is and who the customer is. Although we already know - this is <0>. We need to find out where he is hiding. There are <1> days left until voting ends. It is necessary to find <2> before this date.
        361=You have fulfilled the terms of the contract, keep your <0> cr! See you!

        374=At least someone recognizes me! Did you really recognize me? I'm sorry for my rude answer. Eh, I can't wait to hear someone's opinion on my theory.
        375=You know, it still seems to me that you contacted me not to discuss anything or do scientific research.
        337=Is this all for me? Thanks, <Player>, can you show me what it is? Can't wait to learn more!
        86=I'm rallying here, please don't interfere, they're complaining about me like that already...
        376=None of your fucking business.
        377=<Player>, I'm busy, I don't have time to chat.
        378=Thank you! I am now in your debt. Take at least these <0> cr. in gratitude! All adventures are over. Now I'm flying to <1> and immersing myself in research!
        94=Hello. Don't you want to make some extra money?
        449=You need to circle around the planet <0>. Until you get bored. For a day on orbit, I pay as much as 100 cr! Ponder, <Player>, 100 cr. for simply being in the specified place. You don't even have to kill anyone!<br>But keep in mind that if you are not near the planet for a whole day, there will be no payment.
        380=Hallo, who is this?
        381=Yes, slowly... But the drugs are running out already... Listen, brother, bring 10 tons of dope, huh? I've been hanging out in space for many years, and before that, no, almost...<br>I really want to treat myself after a hard day.
        107=Excellent! Give it here!
        382=Well... There was no such agreement!<br>Okay, what do you want for the container?
        109=How much to give you... <br><0> cr. is enough?
        110=Fucking extortionist. And don't you dare throw me!
        111=Are you out of your mind?! How does the poor ranger get so much money?
        383=Brother, you are helping me out for the second time. There was some unnecessary junk lying around, but greed did not allow me to throw it away. Wait, I'll throw it out now.
        113=So, is the narcos with you?
        114=<Player>, what the hell are you up to?! Get out while you're still intact!
        446=Ah, it's still a fun world, if you settle in it right, don't you agree, <Player>?
        133=Hello, <Player>! I'm flattered to meet you, really. I am honored to be associated with such a great warrior!<br>How can I help you?
        385=Well, how can I say mine... We have a tradition in our family: on coming of age, which we, Gaalians, comes exactly at 55 years old, parents give their children a tranclucator. So I got my first tranclucator. <br>The second one was given to me by my beloved. Twelve years ago, we exchanged with a friend of my great-niece on the father's side of my great-grandfather's mother's daughter. The fourth one somehow got in when he saw the first three. Well, the latter was presented by the Chamber of Commerce of the planet <0> for achievements in business.
        236=Yes, the elections are coming soon, and <0> is hiding. And he promised us so much, he deceived so many!
        386=But <0> is hiding here. At least that's what <1> told us.
        387=He has... vetoed the bill <0><1><2> of the Government of the planet <3> "Pensions for large families with tranclucators". Now there is nothing to even feed the tranclucators. And throwing them out is immoral. Soon I will have to sell the ship to feed them, otherwise they will die.
        388=Hahaldock... I haven't been to my homeland for a long time! I myself follow the events through GalaNet. A gang of fanatics of the Uncontrollable Killeree is terrorizing the civilian population! And this is during the war with the dominators! It's not enough to kill them for that!
        389=Yes, the feyans tried to create something similar, but they failed.
        140=But why do I need it?
        390=I'll try now!
        142=Hello, <Player>. What's new to tell?
        435=Leave, traitor! And I already started to respect you, I thought at least someone decent would show up...
        341=Thank you very much, <Player>! May luck always accompany you!
        161=Hello, <Player>! Our cause is just, we will defeat the dominators!
        179=Yes, I wanted to make some money, I was hired as a courier in the company "MMM" on the planet <0>. I worked for 2 years for their government and that's it... I didn't get paid. And they indebted me whopping <1> cr!
        391=Yes, but what should I do? There was almost no money left for fuel.
        392=No, I don't want to be a beggar.
        393=How fickle this world is, <Player>.
        166=What's your welcome, Mister <Player>? You don't seem to be our regular agent.<br>
        167=Sorry, but we are not giving any quests today. However, do not despair, in a couple of days an urgent matter will surely appear.<br>
        394=Ah, this is all the machinations of the "Maloq MicroModules" company. Alas, we can not help, they are outside our jurisdiction.
        185=This will qualify as exploitation of office. Why should I risk? If there was material motivation... <0> cr. for example.
        180=Yep, I remember. So what did you decide?
        190=Arr, a thousand red-bellied stinkers, <Player>, why did you distub me, grated kalach, space warrior?
        395=Oh, I would like to smack you scull so much for saying that, <Player>, but you're telling the truth. And the second Rachekhan did not work out of me. No, well, just imagine: some frail bearing, with a green mug, like a drowned man, was able to defeat them all, but I can’t! Well, nothing, they will see me again, I will defeat them all!
        192=Looking here for someone to give? Yes, to slap so that the memory remains for the rest of your life! <Player>, you want to experience an unforgettable experience, huh? Come closer, don't be afraid. I will hit gently, but hard.
        193=Ha! Stupid... Dominators seem to be smarter than us, but they achieve everything by force. Why are we worse? We will not become smarter than them, but we can crush them with military tactics!
        238=I'm not a pirate, how many times do I have to say?! If you even think about it one more time, I'll gut you! I became a pirate by accident, and temporarily. I would like to gain my former power, get a powerful ship, and they will all fall at my feet and ask for mercy!
        195=Oh, how can you help me, you don't understand anything in military affairs... Although... Stop. You need a good weapon. Yes. Two guns, the heavier - the better.
        396=For me to ask some nasty pirate for help?! Yes, I'm a pirate myself, but it's disgusting even for me to ask for help from such a carrion as you.
        397=<Player>, get your boring face off my screen or you'll feel worse.
        198=Well, <Player>, did you bring it?
        398=Throw away, I'll pick it up right now.
        399=Wait, I'll pick it up now.
        286=Yeah, cool gun, nothing to say. But that's not enough... Listen, can you bring me another one?
        202=Wow, <Player>, you saved me! Thank you very much! You'll hear about me on the news soon!
        400=Ranger <Player>, vessel <0> is in touch. All ships in this system are under our protection. You have attempted to attack one of the ships. Now I will have to eliminate the intruder.<br>And do not ask for mercy, <Player>, you will be destroyed in any case.
        220=Hey, what are you doing, why did you disperse everyone here?
        401=Who gave you the right... Eh, why did you think they needed help? Maybe they were at work, and you deprived them of it?<br>
        402=Ah, <0> will be very angry... Wait, you can redeem yourself. In fact, this was an extras, everyone thinks that <1> on the planet <2>. But in fact, he is resting in his elite villa on the planet <3>. To avoid problems and stay alive you will have to transport him to a safe place.
        343=Who am I? I am powerful and influential, I can pulverize you! <0> is standing behind me!
        290=Let's check it out now. I ask in advance: "Which coffin should we order for you? Oak or spruce?"
        403=Much more detailed: I will relay the evacuation information to <0> and he will hide in an escape pod aboard my ship. I'll pretend I lost it by accident, dropped it. Then I'll go somewhere. And you will have to pick up the capsule and deliver it to a safe place.
        345=About a day after takeoff, I'll throw it away. We operate without noise, without dust. I terminate the connection. Good luck!
        438=Finally! Security! Tie up this criminal! Yes, not this, this is ranger, the one in the capsule. Well, get it!<br><br><Player>, we are grateful to you. Only you could find <0> in time, and you did it! Well, nothing, now he is waiting for the court. As a keepsake, we left a capsule in the hold of your ship. Well, travel allowances <1> cr. have already been transferred to your account. Also, as an exclusive souvenir, we ordered one of our military to give you one of the deck guns. We look forward to further cooperation.
        405=For me to ask some pathetic merchant for help?! It won't be like this!
        324=As promised by the government, I'm throwing away the multiresonator. <Player>, get it on board!
        440=What, I'll take part!
        296=No, I don't have time. Yes, and it's stupid. What will my one vote decide?
        14=I don't understand... Do you want to buy my vote?
        407=Okay, so be it, I'll fly
        17=Can I vote?
        228=<0>
        23=Can I read the program?
        298=See you soon!
        25=This is such a delicate matter... Well, they tried to bribe me
        26=Yes, I was approached with this offer by the vessel <0>. It's on the orbit now
        408=Okay, get your money ready. Only I, for the sake of conspiracy, will vote for <0>, in order to ingratiate themselves with them. Gibe me ballot, I'll vote
        300=Did you vote yourself?
        353=<0> --> <1><br>Well, where is the promised legalization of narcotic substances?!<br><2> --> <3><br>If I don't have the research center named after Dubovoy, I can't vouch for the consequences.<br><4> --> <5><br><6>, you promised me a grant. Where is it?! How can I feed the tranclucators now?
        76=Well it happened
        301=Hey, why are you talking to a renowned ranger like that, dummy of iron?
        39=Why is your master winding circles around the planet here?
        443=<0><1><2>
        54=What is <0> doing here?
        55=Inform me about the <0> ship's pilot
        56=What do you know about <0>?
        57=From where feyan ship <0> came from?
        96=No, nothing. I don't talk to boors
        412=First, hello
        64=Why are you hanging out on orbit of <0>?
        92=Strong need
        302=Look, I think I'm starting to recognize you... Exactly! because you are the same Dalani <0>!
        303=You know, it's brilliant. Even the dumbest maloq can understand it. And what a sensation it made in the scientific world of the planet <0>!
        304=Which theory are you talking about exactly?
        413=This theory is difficult to understand. However, everything ingenious is not so simple in fact!
        414=It's greatest value lies in her artistic description
        306=Why not? I specially, exclusively, one might say, brought home appliances from the planet <0> for a detailed study
        84=Yes, of course, catch
        307=Yes, you are right, I want to know about your purpose of being here
        308=You again? What is it this time?
        309=Prepare the money
        310=This is all suspicious. No, I do not agree
        116=Ranger <Player>. You, I see, are completely blissful
        415=Okay, I'll help you. Wait. Coming soon
        311=10 tons of narcos, as ordered, on board
        416=Please!
        120=No, I won't give it to you so easily
        121=Buy from me
        348=Not enough. That's twice as much!
        130=Not enough. Multiply this amount by 4!
        131=Not enough. I demand six times more!
        124=Come on, transfer money
        125=Well, whatever you want
        417=Take your drugs and get out of here so I don't see you near <0> again!
        127=Throw everything out of the cargo
        418=Come on, come on!
        145=Listen, are these all your tranclucators?
        419=Well, how is the situation on Hahaldock? There seems to be a wave of some sectarians surging
        147=What are you doing here on orbit of <0>?
        148=Wait, but the elections are taking place on <0>, not here
        314=However, why do you need <0>? After all, there are still candidates!
        420=Sad story... I'll try to help you in any way I can
        151=I have the key to solve your problems! Have you heard about Dominator Energy Packages?
        152=I have it! Fly a little closer, I'll throw it out now
        349=You can connect tranclucators and feed them from Energopacket, the energy from there is almost endless
        154=No, probably nothing new yet
        441=If anything, please contact us!
        169=Hello to you too. And why are you spinning here, instead of killing the dominators?
        170=Now you're asking for justice here?
        171=Would you like me to lend you?
        172=I just offered to help
        421=There are no hopeless situations... I hope
        174=Is there a special task for me?
        422=With nothing, I already need to fly
        350=I'm with you about <0>. A certain company "MMM" hired him to transport goods, but did not pay out
        423=If I give you the money, can you pretend that it was you who paid the victim?
        447=Yes, <0> cr. plus <1> cr... Okay, extortionists, send
        425=Yes, <0> cr. plus <1> cr... No, I can't. Next time, maybe
        315=Nothing yet. I just came to visit you
        184=Too bad...
        203=Yes, I'm flying here, sniffing out what and how. Why are you flying here?
        204=And how did this brave space warrior slide down to the state of a drunken bilge cattle?
        351=Can't we coexist peacefully with everyone? Is it necessary to achieve everything by force? This is stupid!
        426=It's interesting to hear a pirate talking about military honor
        207=Why are you running in circles around here?
        208=If you want, I will help you
        209=I'll try to help you
        427=Not yet. Wait, everything will be soon
        211=Here, there is this thing. Heavy, duh, like you wanted
        212=No, just one is enough for you
        428=Ok. Coming soon
        429=Didn't dispersed anyone, just helped a little
        430=Maybe we can settle the issue amicably?
        247=They told about their troubles and needs, I just satisfied them
        319=Who are you to judge me?
        431=For some reason it seems to me that you, like all politicians and their entourages, can only make promises.
        432=Pine. It's is more fragrant
        320=Oak. Because you yourself are an oak tree yourself. Yes, and you need a coffin. You both will complement each other perfectly
        252=Who are you to order me?
        253=More details?
        321=Okay, when should I fly for the capsule?
        258=I brought him! Here it is, <0>! He's in my hold, in the escape pod.

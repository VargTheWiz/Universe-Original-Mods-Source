        528=</color>I just want to warn you right away - we found non-standard equipment that can only be repaired using <clr> nodes<clrEnd> on your partner's ship.
        529=</color>Oh... Yes, there is work for a long time! And how did your partner manage to bring his ship to such a state, <Player>?<br>Don't worry though. When we're done with, he will shine like new one! Ship - not your partner, of course.
        530=Oh, you upset me, <Player>! I was just about to give a command for a full technical inspection, but it turns out that you didn’t need repairs either.<br>Our center literally lives on such repairs, you understand? And without a wrench and a sledgehammer in hands, what's the point in life?
        531=Well, well, let's do a technical inspection...<br>...<br>Looks like all your artifacts are in excellent condition and do not require repairs.
        541=Repair special agent equipment <0>
        543=Repair probes
        544=Great, the money has already been withdrawn from your account, and our technicians are almost done.<br>All your probes are fixed!
        545=Great, the money has already been withdrawn from your account, and our technicians are almost done.<br>All artifacts are fixed!
        546=Great, the money has already been withdrawn from your account, and our technicians are almost done.<br>Inspect the tranclucator - evaluate the result. Not a single scratch!
        547=Great, the money has already been withdrawn from your account, and our technicians are almost done.<br>Enter the ship and evaluate the result. Not a single scratch!
        548=Well, it seems to you now that it is unacceptable. And when your fuel tank is pierced and the engine fails in combat... What will you do then, <Player>?<br>It's better to fix everything at once, so as not to get into such situation.
        549=You are in vain refusing to repair your tranclucator. Great machine, and most importantly - useful and obedient. After all, he will cover you in battle, and collect things from the whole system for you...<br>You, <Player>, don't appreciate good robotics. Maybe that's why you are ranger.
        550=No matter what a mercenary, but he's a living humanoid, <Player>! Don't you feel sorry for your bodyguards at all?<br>Well, not about him, think about yourself, because the mercenary is your reliable shield! Now, if pirates attack you... But, by the way, why am I wasting time on you...
        551=Of course, <Player>, it can be reasonable... Well, he is just a mercenary, why spend extra money on him? But in a shootout, you are unlikely to meet anyone more reliable than these guys, so I strongly recommend reconsidering investment priorities.
        552=It's very unwise to skimp on your partner, <Player>. When you get into a fight with pirates, you may be able to put your partner under attack, but then it will be your turn! Imagine what will happen if your partner gets out of that mess?<br>It's better to pay a little more for repairs than to get into such a situation.
        553=Well, it's up to you, <Player>. I sincerely wish you good luck in studying planets with faulty probes.
        554=Well that's just wonderful! We've already deducted your greens from your account, and we'll finish the repair any minute.<br>Get on the ship, <Player> - evaluate the work!
        555=Well that's just wonderful! We've already deducted your greens from your account, and we'll finish the repair any minute.<br>Go and check your tranclucator, <Player> - evaluate the work!
        556=Well, you're a greedy, <Player>, you've got money for repairs!<br>What if you run into dominators in the next system? Electronicuses will beat the hell out of you, you'll see!
        557=Hey, <Player>! You don't know the price of a good tranclucator...<br>After all, this is a real miracle of engineering technology! Judge for yourself: he doesn’t demand money for his service, he gives the collected little things himself without talking... This is not a partner - a fairy tale.<br>It would be better to repair it, until it went crazy with you, and didn’t rush to the nearest star at full speed!
        558=<Player>, of course, I don’t like these rebels myself, it’s painful that they are all driven by their ideas. But you still think again - well, how will this libertarian come in handy in battle? So they are hot heads.
        559=I understand you, <Player>, it's better if these mercenaries provide repairs themselves, they are not beggars.<br>But if you suddenly change your mind, you are welcome to repair-doc. The extra money will definitely not hurt us and the guys.
        560=Not according to the rules, <Player>, to refuse a bro in need! Today you won’t give him money to repair the ship, but what tomorrow? And I'll tell you tomorrow. Tomorrow, <Player>, you alone, already without a bro, will get involved in an unequal battle, and in that battle you will disappear without a trace!<br>Think again - you need it, or it might be better to overpay now than later round dances between the stars with space dust wind.
        561=Ah, well, it's up to you. True, you can’t learn much with broken probes, but if you give me a couple of credits, I can give you a magnifying glass from my personal reserves. So to speak, to compensate for the technical and mental lag in development, hehe.
        575=Now let's see...<br>...<br>It looks like all your probes are in perfect order. Come back, as they begin to crumble on the fly, hehe.
        576=Now let's see...<br>...<br>So, so... There are some minor breakdowns... Wow, but this is already more serious! But in general, it's okay.<br>We will easily restore all your probes for just <0> cr. Deal?
        577=Now let's see...<br>...<br>All your probes are in excellent condition and do not need to be repaired.
        578=Well, well, let's do a technical inspection...<br>...<br>Hmm, well, it seems, nothing serious. We will fix everything and restore it for <0> cr.<br>Will this price suit you?
        579=Well, well, let's do a technical inspection...<br>...<br>Looks like all your probes are in excellent condition and do not require repairs.
        580=Well, that's wonderful!<br>All your probes have been repaired, restored and now literally shine like new!
        581=Thank you from the bottom of my heart for not giving up after seeing the price!<br>All your artifacts have been repaired, restored and now literally shine with newness!
        582=Amazing! The mechanics will finish any minute.<br>I suggest you inspect the tranclucator and evaluate the result - the best repair in the Galaxy!
        583=Amazing! The mechanics will finish any minute.<br>I suggest you get on the ship and evaluate the result - the best repair in the Galaxy!
        584=Hanging around in space as a gas cloud, <Player>, that would be unacceptable, and spending credits to repair a ship is still a tolerable alternative.<br>It's up to you, of course, but personally I would recommend not saving money on your "bird".
        585=It hurts to see disrespect for such a wonderful technique! The Tranclucator, <Player> is a smart, obedient, reliable machine, and you treat it like a trace scanner! They are offered a technical miracle on a silver platter, and they only know to turn up their noses. Ugh!
        586=Don't underestimate the loyalty of a mercenary, <Player>. These guys are the right fighters!<br>I myself, once, served as a mercenary, and so a caring client always receives reliable protection from them. And the one who threw the guys on the battlefield, but didn’t give an extra penny - you won’t find him on the list of living pilots.
        587=Oh, you shouldn't be doing this to your partner, <Player>. In such times, it is necessary to help each other, and hold on to friends like to life!<br>Today you turn your shoulder to him, and tomorrow he will turn to you. Eh, in vain you treat him like that, very much in vain...
        588=Ehehe... You leave us without work at all, and without a penny for dinner.<br>Well, it's okay, maybe we'll be lucky with another client.
        590=Well, look, bro - our local kulibins from the plasma wrench and gears repair everything in general, and moreover, for free and without SMS. Although about free - I pinned you, they need to live on something.<br>In short, we can offer <clr>five<clrEnd> options to choose from:<br><0><br><clr>1.<clrEnd> Repair equipment installed right now<br><clr>2.<clrEnd> Repair equipment in all your configurations (including the current one)<br><clr>3.<clrEnd> Repair all artifacts that we find from you on board<br><clr>4.<clrEnd> Repairing all your research probes<br><clr>5.<clrEnd> All-inclusive <br><1><br>What do you choose?

        604=Fix it, you say? You're in the right place!<br>Our network of technology centers has long been renowned for the best and fastest repairs in the galaxy! Yes, what to say! The first center was FOUNDED on the desire to provide everyone with high-quality and affordable technical service. But I warn you right away - we have an extra charge for the repair of non-standard equipment.

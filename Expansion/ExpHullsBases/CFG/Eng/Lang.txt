        1011=Your communicator connected to the <0> communication channel, and soon the worried face of the manager appeared on the monitor:<br><br>The system <1> is under attack, <Player>, so I don't have time for idle talk right now. Tell me the purpose of your call, but only quickly and to the point.
        1014=We will be sincerely happy to fulfill your wish. So, how exactly do you want to use our generator?
        1015=I'm sorry, <Player> but there is no way we can leave the system at such a busy time, when hundreds or even thousands of wounded may need our urgent care. It would be contrary to the basic principles of <clr>medical ethics<clrEnd>.
        1016=More recently, scientists have invented a new defense technology that uses the principle of directional singular deviations of matter. The increase in protection comes at the expense of pointwise distortion of matter in places where enemy shells hit and warping of space in the path of one's own shots.<br>A massive generator is built into the case, using its parts to form an active field.

        1017=It is no secret that the materials commonly used in the construction of spacecraft and stations are extremely expensive and uneconomical. In addition, damaged armor plates often have to be replaced as a whole, because they simply splinter and fall to pieces.<br>Our engineers have had an idea for a long time: replace all the armor of the station with polyxenate armor.

        1022=I'm sorry, but the engine room band told me that our engine power is not enough to make a hyperjump.<br>If you want, go poke around in the motor. Maybe you can squeeze a few extra parsecs out of it.
        1024=I'm sorry, but the engine room abnd told me that our engine is not powerful enough to move this thing.<br>If you want, go poke around in the motor. Maybe you can squeeze a few extra "knots" out of it.
        1025=At the moment you are <clr>very close to the star<clrEnd>, <Player>. I'm afraid that such close proximity to a solar rays could pose a serious threat to the integrity of our station's hull.<br>You must specify other coordinates to make the jump.

Nevertheless, the command respects your merits and combat experience, so you can choose where the station will fly to in the near future.<br>We are ready to execute the order.
        596=Our base is now preparing to strike at an enemy invaded system. This task has been set by the Galactic Council and is of the highest priority, so all flights are temporarily prohibited.<br>By the way, if you want, you can join the operation. We could use an extra pair of hands and guns.
        600=To the hangar

        612=Abort, keep going
        619=As you should know, our base's hyperdrives are very different in power from those on normal ships. Interstellar travel overloads are much higher than allowed, so all personnel and passengers must be kept in special cryo-chambers, and all transported ships must be protected by a stasis field.<br>We weren't planning on hyperjumping anytime soon, so we can't take any extra passengers with us.<br>Contact us from the bridge of your ship, right after takeoff, and give the order to make the jump from there.
        620=Starting the main engines in 3... 2.. 1.. Go... Whoa! That's quite a shake! So, Ranger, are you feeling the power of the Interstellar Coalition?<br>Five seconds, flight normal... If we don't encounter any surprises on the way, we'll be there in <0> <1>.
        622=Jump into the <0> system
        629=To relocate within the system, you must specify a new station location. We can set a course to the current coordinates of one of the <clr>planets<clrEnd> or to the coordinates of your own <clr>ship<clrEnd>.

        648=I'm waiting for confirmation of the relocation order.
        654=Manage base movement
        656=To relocate within the system, you must specify a new station location. Since you yourself are here right now, you can't set your ship as a destination, so you'll have to choose from a list of coordinates of local <clr>planets<clrEnd>.
        659=I also remind you that right now our base is relocating within the <0> system. We are moving at the speed of <2> and should reach our destination in <2> <3>.
        660=At this moment the base <0> is relocating within the <1> system. We are moving at the speed of <2> and should reach our destination in <3> <4>.<br>You can cancel the order or adjust the current course as you see fit.
        666=Set a course for <color=0,50,200>my ship's current location</color>
        670=The new location is <clr>too close to the star<clrEnd>, it is impossible to relocate.<br>Provide different coordinates, <Player>. It's not in our immediate plans to barbecue our own ass.
        671=The new location is <clr>too far away from the star<clrEnd>, it is impossible to relocate.<br>Provide different coordinates, <Player>. Being on the edge of the system, we simply can't defend it in the event of an enemy attack.
        672=The number of space stations in the <0> system is currently sufficient to not worry about its defense capability.<br>We believe that flying there would be an irrational strategic decision.
        673=Crew, get ready for hyperjump!<br>Ranger <Player> - keep your distance and watch. It's a rare sight to see!
        674=Your communicator connected to the communication channel of the military base <0>, and soon the serious face of the captain appeared on the monitor:<br><br>The military base <1> is preparing for hyperjump, so we can't take unauthorized ships on board. Keep your distance!
        677=The course to the current coordinates of the planet <0> is set.<br><br>Distance to target: <1> million km.<br>Base speed: <2><br>Calculated travel time: <3> <4><br><br><5>

        733=Well, that sounds kind of cool - start assembling!
        742=</color> days.
        744=Is there any way I can <color=0,50,200>improve</color> your <color=0,50,200>portal generator</color>?
        748=Oh, it's quite a remarkable device! But to describe it in an accessible way, I will have to delve a little deeper into galactic history.<br>You see, the ancient Gaalian ship blueprints from the time of the Galactic expansion, which were stolen by Rachehan, were discovered and put to use again by the current leaders of the pirate clan. As a result, even before the Dominators' sudden aggression had begun, the pirates had a crude but highly effective device capable of almost instantaneously moving large spacecraft or even entire space stations through space! Unlike bulky military hyperdrives capable of overloading any unprotected organism on board, the portal generator is based on the creation of so-called "bubbles" of warped space.<br>Naturally, the Galactic Council could not simply leave such technology in the hands of the enemy, thereby giving him a serious military advantage, and therefore, as soon as information about the pirate development reached the highest ranks, the ban on the reproduction of hyperspace bubble technology was urgently lifted, and the best minds of the Coalition began to work.<br>In the end, even despite the fact that the ancient technology was extremely complex and the knowledge of their structure partially lost, the problem, the solution of which pirate technicians were struggling for years, our scientists have solved in a few months of not particularly strenuous work. True, unlike those used by the Gaalians in the days of galactic expansion, the bubbles created by the portal generator are quite unstable and therefore cannot maintain a sufficiently reliable structure to move for too long. But, as tests have shown, even a short time spent in the bubble to any space object is quite enough for almost instantaneous movement at a very considerable distance. The most significant disadvantage of the portal generator is that each such movement requires a serious expenditure of energy, and this, in turn, creates significant difficulties with the installation of portal generators on small and medium-sized ships. Incidentally, it was precisely because of this disadvantage that the pirates eventually had to turn their dominions into huge space power plants. And yet, even with all the disadvantages and limitations, the very ability to instantly move such massive objects over such great distances is a true miracle of technology, isn't it, <Player>?<br>Well, now you just have to say yes, and we will immediately begin installing the latest <clr>portal generator<clrEnd> on our station!<br><br><0> <clr>12<clrEnd> parsecs<br>Generator charging time: <clr>45<clrEnd> days<br><1><br>Installation cost: <2> cr.
        749=Yes, in fact, your question itself already partially contains the answer. The developers just thought that the name of such a serious device should not be associated with children's toys or foam generators for baths. Just try to pronounce it aloud - <clr>Bubble Machine<clrEnd>! Yeah, that's what makes it fun!<br>Well, on the other hand, <clr>portals<clrEnd> are also a crucial part of the success of this generator. After all, it is not enough just to create a hyperspace bubble, it is also necessary to move the ship there. It is through such portals that the ship enters the created bubble. One portal on the entrance, the other on the exit.<br>By the way, the principle of action of these portals is probably familiar to you if you have ever visited the so-called "black holes". In fact, they are not any holes, but, in fact, the same portals to hyperspace bubbles, which are also sometimes incorrectly called "hyperspace clots". Such "clots" differ from the bubbles we create only in the fact that they have a natural origin and much more solid size, and are not subject to external control and therefore throw the ships caught inside not in a predetermined point, but at some random one.<br>Well, I think that's enough of your free lectures for today. Will you sponsor the installation of the portal generator or not?<br><br><0> <clr>12<clrEnd> parsecs<br>Generator charging time: <clr>45<clrEnd> days<br><1><br>Installation cost: <2> cr.

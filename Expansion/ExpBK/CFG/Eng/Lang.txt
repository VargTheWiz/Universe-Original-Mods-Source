        129=</color>in just <0> days.
        107=Based on your reputation as an experienced trader, we would also like to suggest that you purchase a special <clr>trading license<clrEnd>, which will not only strengthen your status in the business environment, but also open up a number of new commercial opportunities.
        123=What is this trade license?
        68=Oh, I see you are interested in our special offer? Great!<br><clr>The trade license<clrEnd> is not just a formal document. For all the trading operations of its owners, we have the closest supervision. When you buy and, that's more importantly, when you sell various products, thereby making a financial profit, we carefully record each credit involved in the process. Subsequently, we transfer some of this information to the <clr>ranger centers<clrEnd>, relieving them of the obligation to obtain it on their own. Based on this information, ranger centers compile their statistics and lists of rangers-traders. Of course, the information we receive is usually much more accurate, and therefore the indexing of license holders in these lists is <clr>more accurate<clrEnd>.<br>But don't worry, the illegal aspect of your activity (if any) is completely beyond our control. Of course, as an official organization, we strongly condemn such actions, however, as you know, what is illegal in one place does not necessarily turn out to be illegal in another place... Or even in the same one... In a year or two. What is even more well known is that loans do not smell. In the latter, by the way, I am convinced personally.
        115=Next
        64=Of course, that's not all. Having a trading license will give you access to our special <clr>terminal for remote purchase of goods<clrEnd> on all coalition and even pirate planets. Yes, yes, you heard right! Just imagine what prospects can unfold before you! How many of the biggest sales you will be able to visit, while being on the other side of the galaxy! Of course, we will also receive a modest percentage of your purchases, but, <Player>, you must agree, everyone needs to live on something.<br>By the way, the cheapest way to use such a terminal is on board our business centers, and for more practical customers on our branded galanet site <clr>Intersellar<clrEnd> provides convenient access to the terminal online.<br>Do not forget also about the official status. <clr>A trading license<clrEnd> will increase your credibility in the business environment, and credibility always brings better conditions and more trust.<br>Now all you need to do is say YES! <clr>5<clrEnd> years you will turn from a simple amateur into a real professional, into a business shark! So tell me, <Player>, is there really a better use for pathetic <0> cr?! Come on, be brave - just do it, just say "YES!" your new possibilities!
        153=YES!
        150=This is the right attitude, <Player>! Can you already feel the flames of commerce coursing through your veins? From now on, you are a real merchant!<br>Although I was a little cunning about one signature. In fact, three of your signatures are required at once. Yes, on every instance. No, leave this field blank. Okay, it's okay, now we'll print it out again... And here's another form <clr>DD-1.04<clrEnd>...<br>Well, congratulations - now you are a real merchant already <clr>officially<clrEnd>. And don't forget to renew your license a month before it expires!
        155=I'm not going to join the "Holy Fool" sect, but I'll still take a license
        151=Well, what are you, really, I come to you with all my heart! And, by the way, it doesn't matter anymore... You got the license anyway.<br>By the way, I was a bit cunning about one signature. In fact, three of your signatures are required at once. Yes, on every instance. No, leave this field blank. Okay, it's okay, now we'll print it again...<br>Well, now you are a <clr>licensed<clrEnd> trader. And don't forget to renew your license a month before it expires!
        116=Not interested
        121=You don't understand what you're giving up, I strongly advise you to change your mind! There is no serious profit without investment, <Player> - think about it carefully.
        154=Sorry, but I don't seem to have enough credits
        152=How so, <Player>?! You are a galactic trader without five minutes! Well, it's okay - it's fixable. Let's get you a loan as soon as possible and you can immediately pay for the license.<br>What do you say?
        156=How so, <Player>?! You are a galactic trader without five minutes! Well, it's okay - it's fixable. Just sell something you don't need... Your ship, for example. And you donвЂ™t have to look at me like that, you'll be able to repay the loan at the same time. And for a year or two just save up for a new one. By the way, we recently had a wonderful job opening for a janitor.<br>Hey, <Player>, wait, where are you going?!
        127=We would also like to remind you that your <clr>trading license<clrEnd> is expiring <0> We strongly recommend renewing it, especially since renewing will cost you much less than buying a new license.
        117=Renew trade license
        65=Of course, <Player>, we will gladly renew your license. It is very nice to see such a punctual ranger: many people forget about timely renewal, as a result, losing time and money, because getting a new license costs them much more.<br>Renewal price is <0> cr, while the next <clr>5<clrEnd> years are summed up with the unexpired term, because taking care of you is our credo.
        126=Excellent, I extend
        60=A wise and profitable decision, <Player>! Now, give us your license here...<br>...<br><br>Well, that's it, the database has been updated, and the license has a fresh seal. By the way, forgery of the seal relies on a prison term. As I said: taking care of you is our credo.
        23=I changed my mind
        159=Very unwise of you. The license will expire, and you will still come back to us for renewal, only next time it will cost more.<br>Enjoy your overspending, Ranger <Player>.
        124=We would also like to remind you that you can once again purchase <clr>trading license<clrEnd> from us, which will make your business life much easier.
        125=Purchase a trading license
        118=I'm glad you've decided to purchase our <clr>trading license<clrEnd> again. I will not retell its advantages, because you are no longer a beginner in this matter. I can only once again support your decision.<br>Oh, if only all humanoids were as intelligent as you, and quickly acquired trade licenses from us. Just imagine how our galaxy would change! Perhaps we would have already won the war a long time ago... Don't you agree, <Player>?<br>Anyway, I digress. The price of a trading license for you is only <0> cr, as usual, for a period of <clr>5<clrEnd> years.<br>Finishing?
        120=Definitely
        119=I knew I was right about you, <Player>. You are a real merchant. Yes, you are a real hero! Help us make the galaxy a better place! Let me shake the hero's hand... Don't you want to? Understand. We are simple financiers, and you are a Ranger! Where would we be without people like you.<br>Most importantly, in the heat of your exploits, do not forget to renew your license a month before the expiration date.
        157=Probably not
        158=And I thought that as a former licensed trader, you should be well aware of all the advantages of this document. Looks like I misunderstood you...<br>Well, I'd like to continue being an ex, ranger <Player>.

If the price of repairing your reputation does not suit you, then we recommend that you conduct an independent and honest "work on the bugs", after which we will be happy to resume our fruitful cooperation.<br>Until then, I have to demand that you leave this technology center.
        102=Hip hip hooray! Long live our great leader!<br>We humbly announce that taxes from the <color=255,240,100>Nifigats</color> system in the amount of <0> cr. have just been transferred to your personal account.
        103=Well, in that case, we have nothing more to talk about. Leave this station and find a way to fix your reputation in a more revealing way.
        16=Return credit <0> cr.
        18=Excellent, <Player>! You are certainly an honest ranger.<br>Unfortunately, further cooperation is out of the question at the moment, but we sincerely wish you good luck in your difficult... business. The exit is over there.

        29=<Player>, and you did not confuse anything by chance? I'd better stomp out of here before the bros find out about you! We have accidents here, you know, happen to those who refuse to recognize the authority of the clan.
        3=I'm leaving
        31=What?!! Damn pirate, who even allowed you to drive a ship into our docks!?<br>Well, quickly turn your ship around and get out of here before I order you to be sent to a martial court!!!
        33=Ranger <Player>, your behavior has been deemed unacceptable and your presence on our station objectionable.<br>Please leave science base <0>, and refrain from further visits until you have regained your reputation as a trustworthy humanoid.
        34=Sorry, <Player>, but it's not in our best interest to openly deal with criminals. It's bad for reputation, you know.<br>Of course, you still have credit debt, and therefore we will kindly allow you to pay it off, but immediately after - we urge you to proceed to the exit.
        36=Sorry, <Player>, but it's not in our best interest to openly deal with criminals. It's bad for reputation, you know.<br>Come back when you're a law abiding ranger, but in the meantime, we urge you to leave our business center.
        44=Don't hesitate, <Player>! From now on, you are again on the white list and are free to conduct any activity not prohibited by law.<br>By the way, your money is just enough for us to carry out scheduled maintenance of the station, so, on behalf of all employees dissatisfied with broken air conditioners, let me express special, personal gratitude to you.
        47=I'm glad we were able to find common ground, <Player>. All restrictions on your activities at our base have been completely lifted.<br>We very much hope that you will refrain from such a blatant violation of social norms in the future.
        52=It's time to melt the ice in our relationship. Say exactly what you want!
        53=Leave the business center
        54=Okay, in that case, I hope these <0> cr. will serve the prosperity of the ranger movement!
        57=Okay, in that case, I hope these <0> cr. will contribute to the speedy resumption of our friendly relations!
        58=Yes, that would suit me just fine. I transfer <0> cr. to your account right now.
        60=Next
        62=Ranger <Player>, our network of centers is extremely disappointed with your behavior. You are a disgrace not only to yourself, but to the very noble name of the ranger!<br>Unless you change your behavior for the better, we are determined not to tolerate your presence here. Leave this station immediately. Otherwise, we will be forced to use force!
        63=Well, as a pledge for your future corrections, we could accept a modest contribution of <0> cr.<br>These funds will be used to encourage the activities of other Rangers, which will help to at least partially atone for your guilt to your colleagues.
        66=Contribution accepted, but have no illusions, <Player>. Money is only a symbolic payment.<br>The real correction is waiting for you in the future. Go ahead and prove to the Galaxy that we were right by giving you this ranger badge.
        68=I'm afraid that such a contribution is too big for me
        71=Better watch your own skull get too big! And then my brothers and I can fix it.
        74=Well, it's a pity, but there's no other way we can contribute to your correction. We wish you good luck in your search for redemption somewhere else.<br>Now, if you don't mind, we urge you to proceed in the direction of the exit.
        75=Well, your sins against a reasonable and responsible form of behavior are undeniable, and we can do nothing about it. However, as partial compensation for the harm you caused, we could charge you a fine of <0> cr., which would be put to good use immediately.<br>Would such a compromise suit you?
        77=Listen, well, maybe we can somehow agree on a brotherly way, huh?
        78=Yeah, that means how to bring down the guys in lawlessness, so you are the first, but how to answer for actions, like this: "Well, please, well, like a brother, nya-nya-nya..." - so what?!<br> I'll tell you what, <Player> - you're a lousy <0>. Lousy and pathetic. I would throw up at your feet, but after yesterday's booze there is nothing more. However, even for such personalities as you, the brotherhood does not refuse need. Not for free though.<br>In short, the amount of <1> cr. transfer to the common fund - and for the time being we will close our eyes to this rot of yours.
        79=I confess - I'm a trembling creature! Here are your <0> cr., and I won’t offend bros anymore
        80=Okay, already gone
        81=Okay, so be it - have fun, ragged! At least boys will feast properly at your expense.<br>So what did you want at the base? Speak - now no one will bite, hehe.
        83=Okay, in that case, I hope these <0> cr. worthily serve the cause of peace and prosperity of your corrupt ass! You're a fucking accountant!
        84=In that case, I'm afraid I can't help you.<br>Please proceed to the exit, and try not to slam the Gaaldock Marblewood door too hard along the way. The door, by the way, was bought with a donation from one of your predecessors, who is currently roaming the universe in a brand new ship purchased with a loan from US.<br>Just think about it, Ranger <Player>.
        86=Well, what do you think yourself, being in the office of the manager of one of the galactic business centers?<br>I'll give you a hint - this is a number, and this number, as it happens, is a multiple of <0>. Equally, to be completely accurate. I'm still a businessman, not a robber.
        89=You're not very good at business negotiations, are you? Okay, I accept your modest charitable donation for the maintenance of our, let's say... aquariums with the endangered species of the Rakhish quaglyash.<br>Well, now for the next week you are included in the list of our voluntary sponsors, which means you have the right to priority service regardless on your current reputation.<br>So how can I help you, dear sponsor?
        91=Well, okay, I didn’t really want to!
        93=Wow, just look! This is what an interesting ranger here brought to us by a stellar wind!<br>What, <Player>, have you been blacklisted? Yes, I see that I got it - do not deny it. So what, so right away you decided to drop the anchor "on your native shores"? Thought the bros would help? That bros are always welcome to bros?<br>So know that we are not bros anymore, you understand!!? Get out of here, you rat-faced nit, before you are shoved into the garbage lock with my own boots!!!
        94=Ranger <Player>, you are a highly unwanted guest on our station. Your entire reputation literally screams that it is more expensive to do business with you.<br>Guided by these considerations, we are forced to ask you to leave our small docks. Right now!
        97=Well, I think for a reasonable price we could temporarily turn a blind eye to your obvious unreliability.<br>Let's say <0> cr. Deal?
        BK_Block=<Player>, you are an unwanted guest at BaseName Business Center. Check with the station manager to sort things out.
        CB_Block=<Player>, you are an unwanted guest on the BaseName dominion. You are strongly advised to leave the station until the reputation in the eyes of its captain is corrected.
        PB_Block=<Player>, you are an unwanted guest at BaseName pirate base. Drop in to the captain of the station to sort things out.
        RC_Block=<Player>, you are an unwanted guest at BaseName Ranger Center. Check with the station manager to sort things out.
        SB_Block=<Player>, you are an unwanted guest at BaseName Science Base. Check with the station manager to sort things out.
        TC_Block=<Player>, you are an unwanted guest at the BaseName Technology Center. Check with the station manager to sort things out.

If you want our offer, you've got to be brave and courageous, strong of body and spirit, skilled with various weapon types, an excellent pilot, capable of following orders but also taking the lead at any moment, if necessary. And finally, the right candidate cannot have any mental issues. Morons have extremely limited prospects for career growth at our enterprise. <br>Now be honest with us both -- do you meet these rigid standards?

            RangerNo=Wake up first, otherwise you are talking some nonsense here.
            RangerNo1=Come on, take cargo from me. Or are you just so formidable on the communicator?
            RangerNo2=Cargo, you say? So be it, I’m ready to drop the sealed bag with the contents of the toilet especially for you. Or are you talking about something else?
            RangerNo3=I would teach you a lesson, but I will regret space ecology. Well, then a lot of wreckage will remain from your ship...
            RangerNo4=I will not give you the cargo in principle. You just hang in there.
            RangerOk=You win. Stop firing, I'll drop cargo now.
            RangerOk1=Why not? No, it’s not because of you that I’m throwing away part of the cargo, it’s just that there really isn’t enough space on the ship.
            RangerOk2=I'll throw away cargo, but I remember you well! Better not get in my eyes again.
            RangerOk3=I worked hard from morning to night for this cargo, not at all in order to then give it to an asshole like you. So be it, hold on, but this is the last time!
            RangerOk4=Still, guns are the most weighty argument in a civilized dispute. Do not shoot, now you will have the cargo.

            RangerLongDistance=What? Money? Well, of course, I like nothing better then just transfer my money to the first inappropriate person I meet, who is broadcasting on the air from the other end of the system. If suddenly you didn't got it, which I won’t be surprised at, then this is sarcasm.
            RangerLongDistance1=Where do you get these from? Do you want my money? You can't even catch up with me!
            RangerLongDistance2=And if I suddenly refuse, will you get very angry with me and won't catch up?<br>Oh no, don't do it! Please!
            RangerLongDistance3=What's the point of paying you if from this distance you pose no threat to me at all?
            RangerLongDistance4=I get scared for our pirate business when I meet people like you. Before you extort, at least fly closer to the victim! Everything has to be taught to the youth of today...

            RangerLongDistance6=How daring you are! Send me your photo, as soon as I land on the nearest planet, I will definitely sell it to journalists. Just imagine: the report "Moron of the Year"! So I see: "he robs ships from gigantic distances!" Hey, what's wrong with you? Come on, buddy, this is a joke.
            RangerLongDistance7=Only if you catch up with me and give me a good reason to pay you. Oh yeah, it doesn't work for you. Well, then no.
            RangerLongDistance8=I wouldn't be able to transfer money to you at such a great distance with all my desire, so I'm sorry. No, I'm not laughing - it's such interference.
            RangerNo=I'm already transferring. How did it not come? Well... I'm out of business here. Yep.
            RangerNo1=You would fly, you half-educated robber! Now I will inform my sidekick, so he will correct your nozzles!

            RangerNo3=I honestly stole my money and I won’t give it to you!
            RangerNo4=What? It seemed to me, or did you really want to demand money from me now?<br>Come on, get the hell out of here while I'm still kind!
            RangerNo5=This is not my money, but that transport worker over there, so demand it from him.
            RangerNo6=No no no! I'm still paying off the mortgage. You want to plunge me into poverty, don't you?
            RangerNo7=But then I won't have enough to feed my parrot! Do you really want poor bird to starve?<br>How cruel you are.
            RangerOk=Okay, okay, you can put your guns away, here's the money. Not mine, I can think that I have not lost anything!
            RangerOk1=So I saved them, saved up, robbed, traded smuggling, didn’t sleep at night, ate badly! And then you showed up! Well, you're not ashamed, are you? Okay, hold on...
            RangerOk2=Well, we'll have to give away the stash... So, now it's enough! Take it, just stay away!
            RangerOk3=Maloq hard red mixed with green surprise! Well, you are addictive! That's enough, take it, well done, you cool.
            RangerOk4=Easy come, easy go. I'll fly, I'll try to catch up with that transporter again...
            RangerOk5=My grandmother told me: "Don't fly, grandson, at night!" I didn't listen to her...
            RangerOk6=But I really wanted to buy that gun... Every day I went, admired the shop window... Okay, I have to pay, take it...
            RangerOk7=But it's true: everyone in the galaxy should share and everyone will be fine! Today I am for you, tomorrow you are for me!
            RangerSumIsVeryBig=Are you laughing at me? How can I have such money?!
            RangerSumIsVeryBig1=What are you talking about? I have never even held such an amount in my hands!
            RangerSumIsVeryBig2=Buddy, please don't hit me! Well, I don't have that amount!
            RangerSumIsVeryBig3=I'm afraid I don't have that much money. Maybe we can agree on a smaller amount?
            RangerSumIsVeryBig4=Oh, you flattered me... If I had that amount of money, I would, perhaps, not hang out in cold space, but would now be resting somewhere on Mauna Roa...

        23=What is the ranger rating?
        24=What are the responsibilities of a ranger?
        25=For each ranger we have a separate <clr>micromodule storage<clrEnd>. The storage allows you to get the micromodule hidden in it at any of our centers.<br>Strictly speaking, this "storage" is not storage in the physical sense of the word. In fact, it is a single database, and our centers redistribute micromodules that have been "deposited" at their own discretion. When the owner wishes to get them back, the appropriate ranger center simply hands over other, identical devices to the deposited ones. And don't worry, any of our centers always have a sufficient stock of a variety of micromodules to provide personal "storage" for every Ranger in the Galaxy.<br>Would you like to use your storage right now?
        26=Thanks, maybe another time
        27=Hand over unknown micromodules

        33=Of course, of course!

Based on their design, we will be able to better understand the nature of these amazing devices, which in the future will allow us to create even more advanced analogs.
        4=Which micromodule do you want to move <clr>to storage<clrEnd>?

        6=Move the micromodule to the storage
        60=How can I help the Coalition against the klissans?
        61=The current situation with the appearance of klissan ships in our worlds is still completely unclear, as are the detailed circumstances of the entire incident.<br>Although two centuries ago, during the Second Klissan War, the Rangers were able to contact the klissan mind center and resolve the conflict peacefully with the help of an advanced scientific development, the Mental Communicator, their ships have now invaded our space again. They attack other starships without warning for no apparent reason.<br>Unfortunately, we still haven't been able to locate the Machpella responsible for the attacks, but our analytical departments are now working hard to solve the problem.
        62=However, as it turned out during several encounters with the invaders, their biological structure has changed considerably. The klissans now make extensive use of semi-mechanical equipment, and the old organs have either died out or been radically transformed, changing their primary function. It is not yet clear whether this is the result of two hundred years of evolution, or someone else's interference.<br>One of the main features of the "new" klissans is that they create large nests in space - neurolinks - serving to regenerate old and incubate new "ships". Since these constructions pose a serious danger to both system inhabitants and spacecraft pilots, we encourage their complete and unequivocal elimination.
        64=Next
        65=Thank you, I found out everything I need to know
        68=How can I help the Coalition against the klissans?
        69=To answer your direct question, the best way for the Coalition to help us fight the klissans is to turn over all the collected klissan materials to scientific bases for further study.<br>Only by knowing the enemy can we put an end to this unexpected aggression.
        7=Take the micromodule out of storage
        70=Nodes are microscopic elements which comprise the entire dominator control chain. A dark legacy of klissan technologies which has found new life in Coalition machines. These technologies are so complex, it will take millennia to study and decode them.<br>Nevertheless, we've already found practical use for them. When arranged in certain combinations, the nodes turn into universal devices, suitable for utilization with Coalition technology. This fact actually makes perfect sense. After all, at their core the dominators are our machines, and the nodes have adapted to them.<br>Our specialists went on to design various performance enhancing micromodules from them. These devices can be adapted to all types of equipment, boosting its parameters. The only drawback to the micromodules is that they are fundamentally incompatible with one another, meaning you cannot install two on the same piece of tech.<br>In an effort to restock the raw materials needed to produce new micromodules, a chain of our centers has acquired license <clr>XC-112<clrEnd> to process the nodes. Rangers bring the nodes to us, and, in accordance with their node accounts, we supply them with assembled micromodules, ready to be integrated in their equipment.<br>To be sure, rangers don't get everything they want. Enhancing micromodules are in great demand. As per terms of our license, rangers are issued no more than <0>% of all assembled micromodules. The rest are distributed among various military and diplomatic vessels of the Coalition.
        71=We need an agent to infiltrate the pirate's ranks and win over their trust. If you don't yet know about their "special offer," then head on over to any pirate base and you'll understand. Then you just keep on climbing their career ladder and have the smarts to recognize when we come calling...<br>But be very careful, as some of your predecessors are already floating in space as separate atoms after the pirates made them. Know that without accurate information about the pirates' plans and their leader's location, brute force will not help us. We can drive them out of star systems all we want, but they'll just keep coming. Information is the only thing that can put an end to this war, <Player>.
        72=Is it your first time here or something? The galactic ranger rating is the classification system used to rate our pilots based on experience.<br>Experience points can be earned in a variety of ways. Government missions and military operations against the dominators always yield considerable experience. But experience can also be gained in any skirmish with the Coalition ships, executing trades, handing in basic dominator elements, and so on. Basically, everything that you do will grow both your experience and rating.<br>Most importantly, gaining experience enables rangers to hone their skills. For instance, by developing leadership a ranger will be able to command other ships, while developing mobility will improve his chances of evading enemy fire in combat.
        73=According to the ranger code, the main responsibility of every ranger is to search and terminate dominators. Unlike the military fleet, however, rangers are free to choose how to go about it. Rangers are completely autonomous -- physically, as well as economically. A ranger must be capable of making independent decisions and showing initiative, whether by supporting a military operation, undertaking a government mission or accruing personal wealth.<br>Remember, <Player>, you are your own boss and you answer to no one. For this reason, no matter the situation you find yourself in, let your conscience and sense of duty guide you. Do your best to uphold the reputation of our movement by helping civilian ships, helping to ease relations between the Coalition races, and doing charity when you can.<br>You have your entire life ahead of you. Live it with dignity. Then the dominators will never defeat us.
        75=All micromodules from your hold have been successfully moved to the storage.<br>Anything else you'd like to do?
        77=All micromodules from the storage have been successfully moved to your ship.<br>Anything else you'd like to do?

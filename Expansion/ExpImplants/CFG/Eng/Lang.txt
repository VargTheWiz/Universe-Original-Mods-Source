            Start=<Date><br>You started exuding a rather peculiar smell. The ship's first-aid kit displayed the diagnosis: <clr>New Molizone<clrEnd>. This notion is closely related to the "name carrier," i.e. the fetus. According to long-established standards, the infected host, which is essentially every mature gaal, carries a fetus which absorbs all of the host's thoughts and desires until the fetus assumes full control. After that, the fetus leaves the host body and becomes independent.
            Start=The fetuses undergo a period of hormonal activation, called "New Molizone." During this time the host's organism becomes toxic, making food and any other objects touched by the infected gaal hazardous for other living beings. At the same time, the process positively affects the host's reaction time, accuracy and mobility.
            Start=There are two treatment options. Wait until the hormonal activation stage is over: avoid handling food or medication, focusing on combat activities instead. Or undergo a deactivation course at a treatment center; naturally, this option is more sensible.
            Text=Selling food or medication is strictly prohibited on all planets (and is deemed a contraband operation). Hormonal exchange is activated, leading to improved accuracy and mobility.

        117=Vaccination against <0> (<1> cr).
        119=Vaccination against
        120=Install <0> (<1> cr).
        121=Vaccinations are a good thing. They give almost complete immunity to a certain disease and last quite a long time. Our network of Medical Centers has always been in favor of vaccinations, but lately the anti-vaccination movement has become very popular, so we have been required by law to also talk about the disadvantages of this method...<br>Firstly, vaccinations can contribute to a weakening of the general immunity, there is no scientific evidence of this, but we have to warn you about this possibility. Secondly, if your immune system is not strong enough, it may not cope even with a weakened version of the virus contained in the vaccine, in which case you will fall ill after some time. Therefore we recommend not to leave our base after vaccination, or at least not to fly far away. Thirdly, any organism can only support the production of a limited number of types of antibodies, if there are too many of them they can start to perceive each other as a threat to the organism and... Simply put, we don't do more than 3 vaccinations at a time. Believe me, it's for your own good.<br>I hope this is not a problem for you. Let's cut to the chase. Right now you have <0> types of antibodies in your body. This means that we can give you <1> more vaccinations against the following diseases:<br><2>
        122=Well, well... Let's see... No, you already have too many different antibodies in your system, so new vaccinations will not be effective. Come back later when your vaccinations expire, but for now, please don't hold up the line.
        123=Well... That's it, the biomodule <0> has been successfully installed. Doesn't hurt at all, does it? And you were afraid. You should be on bed rest for at least five days postoperatively and... You're not going to follow our advice, are you? You Rangers are all like that. I know, I know, saving the galaxy and all that, but no one can take care of your health but yourselves. Remember that. Okay, since you don't care about your health at all, we can put in another implant, of course, if you want, but I don't recommend it.
        130=Well, why do you keep me from my work, then? If you don't like our terms, go to the doctors. We're not here to babysit you. If you need a biomodule, we'll install it, if you don't need one, don't take up my time.
        133=</color>Before installing, let's check the conflict table. So... biomodule <0>... conflicts with biomodule <1> and causes an irreversible reaction in the area... well, we're not interested in the rest. Pick another implant, dead clients are bad publicity.
        134=Well, that's great. Like I said, our implants aren't as expensive as the doctors', and we give them to our own guys even cheaper. By the way, have you forgotten what's cheaper for your guys? Your pirate rating entitles you to a discount of <0>%<br>So, what do we have today:<br><1>And keep in mind, we don't do any scans here. That's another reason why you take full responsibility. If you feel your body can't take it, don't put in the biomodule, but make your own decision. We're not your babysitters to wipe your snot.
        136=I couldn't agree more with your decision. Biomodules are undoubtedly useful, but also very dangerous. Before you know it, you may lose part or all of yourself. The great Gaalian philosopher and iike-baanist Baal-Da once said, "When one of the flowers in your ike-baana withers and you replace it, it is still the same iike-baana as it was before. Then another flower withers, and you replace it, and then another and another. Eventually, you replace all the flowers. Is it still the same iike-baana? Or is it not anymore?"... Do you understand how profound this thought is, and how it applies to you? Were you even listening to me? Oh, well, that's up to you.
        137=Ah, well, biomodules are a good thing. But be warned, it's not the safest. However, I'm not going to burden you with all this bullshit, if you're interested - fly to the doctors, they will explain everything to you clearly. We are dealing here with self-sufficient, independent and responsible humanoids. There are no guarantees, other than a cheap implant and a performed surgery. If there are any problems, we are not to blame.<br>Because we have access to places you don't even know about, we can get implants relatively cheaply. On average, we sell them for a third less than in the medical centers. Believe me, the markup there is only for the brand sticker, so rest assured - all the functionality is in place. But the best part is the forbidden biomodules. You wouldn't believe how many interesting implants the Coalition, for one reason or another, bans. You can't find them on the official market, but you can sometimes find them here. They are usually much more expensive, but believe me, if anything is worth the money, it's them.<br>Now a little bit about the downside: the equipment is a piece of gobzawian feces. Even with all our professionalism, it is extremely difficult to operate using THIS. Complications after surgery are almost inevitable. Because of that, the load on the organism from our biomodules is, on average, one and a half times higher than that of similar ones installed in medical centers. I'm telling you this right away, so that I don't have to listen to your whining later. So, if you do not have a problem with all this, then, as they say, welcome.
        138=We are glad that you know how to save yourself in time. Do not ignore the dangers of biomodules, despite their undoubted usefulness. Most importantly, do not forget to monitor your well-being and at the first sign of complications, if they appear, please contact us as soon as possible.
        140=Finally, you have to wonder how many implants you will be able to put in. You see, the number is limited not only by the strain on the body, but also by certain physiological characteristics. So, let's say, hypothetically, anyone can have four bionic arms installed, but only a Paleng can use them successfully, because the body of a member of another race is simply unable to understand how to operate two extra arms, while a Paleng who was born with four arms would have no problem with it. It's the same with the rest of the body - Faeans, thanks to the faceted structure of their brain, can effectively use up to four implants of the appropriate type, other races are not able to coordinate more than two, and Gaalians, from birth have three eyes and, accordingly, can effectively use three eye implants. That is, in fact, all the general information. Now that you fully understand the risks and possibilities we can, in good conscience, invite you into the operating room.
        141=Well, look... Otherwise, I might change something else for you. Do you want the eyes of a pinchecracker? And the gills? You don't want them? Fine. Enjoy your new body parts, and if you're thinking of adding another piece of hardware, I'm always here.
        144=</color>You already have <0> installed! Sorry, <Player>, but our surgeons only know one place where the biomodule can be connected and it's already occupied.
        146=You left us so quickly, and we wanted to give you a special gift as a special thank you for the completed task... But now it is too late, unfortunately. So instead of a gift accept this modest sum of <0> cr. You can consider it as an extra bonus for completing our mission. Have a good flight.
        147=Ranger, your help to our planet has been appreciated and we have decided that you deserve an additional award of <0> cr. We look forward to our continued cooperation.
        148=The head of our planet's government has a big holiday today - a new addition to the family, and in his joy he wrote bonuses for everyone. Including you, for completing the task. He seemed to like you... Anyway, congratulations on your extra fee of <0> cr.
        149=Thanks to surgery, Augmentation Fever is no longer a threat to you.
        150=Do you want to empower your own body? That's commendable. A lot of people these days are thinking about it. Significantly improved skills, completely new capabilities, and all it takes is paying money and laying in the operating room for a few hours. It's a fairy tale, but it's not that simple.<br>The installation of implants or, as they are now fashionably called, biomodules, is a complicated operation. There can be complications, and I'm not even talking about the strain on the body that the biomodules themselves have. In general, we strongly recommend that you take the decision to put one of them in your body with the utmost seriousness and responsibility.<br>We are here to provide you with the highest quality medical service and only verified licensed implants. Yes, yes, despite the fact that we are in a system owned by a pirate syndicate, where it would be easy to find cheap counterfeits, we continue to order biomodules exclusively from trusted suppliers, or even from manufacturers directly. Of course this is expensive, but believe me, for the reliability it is worth paying extra. If you want to learn more about biomodules, you can listen to our briefing, if you are here for the first time, we strongly recommend you do it.
        152=They say you can get biomodules here
        153=</color>No. We can't do it that way. It is physically impossible to install another biomodule here. Of course, I can understand your desire to get cybernetic, but be careful, you might become a dominator. Why don't we cut something out for you? We're good surgeons... when we're sober.
        158=<clrEnd>Stamina needed: <clr>
        159=Bruteforce found working copies of anti-dominator programs... download completed.
        160=It is important to understand that biomodules, or, scientifically speaking, bionic modular augmentations, are not as safe as they may seem at first sight. Of course, they cannot cause addiction, like, for example, stimulants, but biomodules have a certain load on the organism.<br>Every living organism can only withstand a certain load, but if it is exceeded, complications begin to appear - severe pain, difficulties in controlling the bionic prostheses, sometimes even hallucinations. We call this condition augmentation fever. There is no cure at the moment. The only way to cope with this condition is to reduce the load on the body, or to increase the threshold of its endurance. <br>You must be wondering how to avoid such complications. In fact, there is nothing difficult - just be careful and don't install everything in your body. Remember that the body's stamina is directly related to race. If we take dry statistics and abstract from random individual peculiarities, we get the following picture: Faeyans have the lowest level of endurance among the races of the Coalition, Gaalians are slightly more enduring, Humans and Pelengs are a little more enduring than Gaalians, and the absolute champions are Maloqs.
        164=<clrEnd> is already implanted in your body. Each biomodule affects a specific area in your body, installing two identical biomodules will cause an increased load on that area. I have to refuse you.

        166=<clrEnd> and at the same time avoid conflicts, you can't. Too many are already implanted in this area. You can choose to have other biomodule implanted in another area of your body if you wish.

Yeah, we can do that too. Pretty cool, huh?<br>By the way, haven't you forgotten that it's cheaper for our guys? Your pirate rating entitles you to a discount of <clr><0>%<clrEnd>.<br>So here's what we can cut out of you:<br><1><br><2><3><br>Well, what are we going to remove?

You can be absolutely relaxed: even if you have replaced most of your body with cybernetics, we can reassemble you in the most original way possible.<br>So, the following biomodules are currently implanted in your body:<br><0><br><1><2><br>What shall we remove?
        183=Right now there are <clr>no stimulants<clrEnd> in your body, but we're still glad you're taking such good care of your health. Keep it up and you'll live a long and full life.
        184=It is a joy to finally meet a conscious humanoid who understands the harm that chemical doping can do to him.<br>We can <clr>remove<clrEnd> any stimulant from your body by injecting a special substance that reacts with the stimulant molecules, which leads to their mutual destruction. The procedure is simple and absolutely harmless, but its main advantage is that we can remove only those stimulants that you request to be removed, without affecting the others.<br>Alternatively, we could do a <clr>comprehensive cleansing<clrEnd> of the body of all stimulants as well as other harmful substances, bacteria and parasites at the same time. Such a cleanse will not only rid your body of stimulants, but also allow you to temporarily <clr>improve your general immunity<clrEnd> and, as a result, your resistance to various diseases. In the interest of your health, I strongly recommend that you pay attention to such a procedure.<br>According to the test results, you now have the following stimulants in your body:<br><0><br><1><2><br>I am also obligated to remind you that although removing stimulants will stop their destructive effects on the body, it will not be enough to repair the damage that has already been done.
        185=<clrEnd>However, there are other stimulants left in your body:
        186=That's it. We did a comprehensive cleansing of your body from stimulants and all other harmful substances. You are medically clean as a baby!<br>This procedure will temporarily help your body to cope better with external illnesses, because it has no one to fight with inside itself.<br>I ask you very much to maintain our work, and from now on to try to lead an exceptionally healthy lifestyle.

We may as well have another surgery to remove some other biomodule, if necessary.
        33=Do you want to empower your own body? That's commendable. A lot of people these days are thinking about it. Significantly improved skills, completely new capabilities, and all it takes is paying money and laying down for a few hours in the operating room. It's a fairy tale, but it's not that simple.<br>The installation of implants or, as they are now fashionably called, biomodules, is a complicated operation. There can be complications, and I'm not even talking about the strain on the body that the biomodules themselves have. In general, we strongly recommend that you take the decision to put one of them in your body with the utmost seriousness and responsibility.<br>We, in turn, will provide you with the highest quality medical service and only verified licensed implants, this is very important, believe me, you do not want a cheap Rakhish fake to fail right inside your body. It's best not to save money on that. If you want to learn more about biomodules, you can listen to our briefing; if this is your first time here, we highly recommend you do so.
        37=<0>
        39=Of course, stamina can also be improved. Many stimulants, and as recent research has shown, even some diseases, can increase the body's endurance. One of the best choices in this case is Blood Djogar, but in general any stimulants that strengthen the body, improve brain function or increase willpower in one way or another help to combat stress. But it is necessary to understand that any stimulants have a temporary effect. In addition, you need to keep in mind the diseases. Yes, some can help the body to cope with the load, but the vast majority only interferes. From this follows two simple ways to prevent augmentation fever - injecting stimulants and treating diseases. Of course, this may not always be enough, especially if the fever does start. That leaves the last, most radical, but most reliable method - removal of some or all of the biomodules.
        41=Next
        44=Okay. As I said before, we only provide licensed biomodules, but this will not protect you completely against possible complications. Before we start the operation, we will run some tests, and if they show that your body cannot handle the load, the operation will be denied. The tests are, of course, free of charge.<br>So, our station currently has the following biomodules:<br><0>Now we're going to do a little scanning...<br><1>
        52=We are done. Everything is just fine, the stitches are almost invisible, the biomodule <0> is fully functional and ready to work. By the way, did you know that a lot of women are crazy about this kind of hardware, huh? I advise you to use it, if you know what I mean. Well, while you're digesting this information, we can give you a couple more implants, if you want, of course.
        55=Biomodule <0> successfully removed, and then there are a few minor things. There will be a small scar, but that's nothing to worry about, right? Other than that, no consequences. You're good as new. If there's anything else you want removed, we can get you back on the table, no problem.

    ReadMe=General chances of issuing for different types of ships (the higher the chance, the more often the corresponding ships will get implants), as well as the chances of getting different number of implants for ships that already got infoshka (i.e. have at least 1 implant): Min - minimal increase in the number of implants, Max - maximal, and the rest are just intermediate stages. Bots (fae on 8 GTU) cannot set more than 8 implants. To update all set parameters (including sections of specific implants) on old safes, you need to change ImplantsVersion to any arbitrary value other than the previous one.
    ReadMeMore=The output of a particular biomodule for one of the 6 basic classes is set up in the section of the corresponding biomodule. If you set the value 0 against the class, this biomodule will not be issued to representatives of this class. If the value is greater than 0, then it will be summed with the value opposite the parameter of the corresponding race of the pilot of the ship, and together with it will constitute the chance for the issuance of this implant, if it randomly falls out to this ship in the issuance cycle. In essence, this total chance represents the frequency of issuing these particular biomodules to representatives of a certain class and a certain race.
    ReadMeMoreAgain=Parameter BioworldInSlotCoef means the modifier that will be applied to the pilot's innate stamina if Bioworld is installed in the ship slot. Parameter BioworldInHoldCoef means the modifier that will be applied to the pilot's congenital stamina if the Bioworld is in the hold and an Artifactor is installed in the slot. To completely disable the modifier you must set the parameter to 1.0, otherwise the stamina will be penalized, up to its complete nullification.

        1364=Hello! Welcome to JSC <color=0,50,200>"Highwayman"</color> General Director.<br>According to an unofficial agreement between our company and a third party who, shortly before these events, carried out transfer of your hull, he (that is, a third party) I pledged, I quote: "I swear! For a card debt I will give you this fool's hull, in kind!" - which, according to the charter of our company, is considered a completely legal form of transfer of property, because you transferred your hull to the above third party while being in a sober mind and vigorous memory. However, since  transferred hull did not fully satisfy our material needs, we decided to return the hull back and demand full financial compensation for its market value instead. Demand from you.<br>In a more familiar language - come here <0> cr., moron, we're already tired of waiting for you with brothers!
        1365=Oh, you're lucky that I'm kind today. And we will use your money for a good cause - we will go and get drunk in a tavern for  health of such fools as you! Aha-ha-ha!<br>Come on, you yourself, force out of here while  flaps of your ship are intact! After all, I can still change my mind.
        1366=Hey muzzle! I'm talking to you!<br>Recently, a fool from a transfer agency played cards with us and, in payment of a debt, merged your hull. But since this hull was not his, we decided that it would be beyond our understanding to shut it up like this.<br>In short, we returned the hull, but for this now YOU have to REFUND it's full price, namely <0> cr., Do you understand?! If it's clear, then quickly give  money here, otherwise me and guys don't like to joke!<br>And me and guys don't like to wait too long either!
        1367=</color>Hey ranger! Soon your ship will crack in half, and then what do you order us to do? You'd better transfer the money, but as soon as possible!<br>We'll get ours - we'll fall behind right away. I swear!

        1384=Sorry, <Player>, but bargaining in this matter seems completely inappropriate to us. It's about your reputation, after all, so please be serious.<br>So, are you taking on the elimination of pirate <0> or not?

Everyone knows that there is a war going on and any self-respecting Gaalian wants the war to finally end, but the cruel truth of this life is that in order for the war to end, you need to fight. And now any Gaalian makes a choice - to remain true to the precepts of pacifism, which the Code of Ga teaches us, or to fight and thereby bring peace and prosperity closer to the entire Galaxy.<br>My friends and I made our choice: we will fight, protect civilians, maintain order and, most importantly, justice. But this is not so easy in our world, in a world where you have to pay for everything, especially for well-equipped warships. That's why we need your help, if the funding of the project is successful, then the <0> ships, united in the squad, which we decided to call <1>, will be able to go into space in order to bring at least a little harmony to this mad world. Now we are on the planet <2> in the system <3> from here our mission <4> will begin. Our thanks in advance.<br>Funds raised: <5>/<6> cr.
        386=We are glad to welcome you, friends. It's no secret that the current war is having a very negative effect on the interests of simple and honest entrepreneurs, which, of course, we are. I think we can all agree that the regular army is doing its job very badly, which means that we, as always, will have to do everything ourselves.<br>My friends and I are also honest entrepreneurs (<0> of us), we can do it. We even came up with a name for our gang - <1>. We have ships, but bad luck, the weapons and equipment are old and mostly non-working. Providing our ships with the required equipment is a very financially intensive task, and therefore we need your help. We guarantee that at least half of the money received will be honestly spent on equipment and weapons. We are currently on planet <2> in system <3>. From here we plan to start our combat activities <4>, in case of successful financing of the project. We look forward to your support.<br>Raised funds: <5>/<6> cr.
        462=Welcome to the website of our eco-society "Clean Space".<br>Did you know that for every inhabitant of the Coalition there are more than 1000 tons of space debris annually. But in space there are practically no factors affecting the decomposition of objects! That little Machpella jar that you once threw overboard is still somewhere in space and will be there forever. Who cares, you ask! For one can, of course, no one, but there are trillions of such cans and not only cans - containers with ownerless cargo, parts of ships destroyed long ago, and just the most common minerals left after the destroyed asteroid - all this is garbage, and when there is a lot of garbage, there is a lot problems. Large accumulations of space debris seriously impede navigation, the fall of debris on the planets, not only is it dangerous in itself, but also further worsens the ecology of the planets, large accumulations of debris around the stars can prevent light from reaching the planets, which can lead to catastrophic climate changes, in short, the problem of space debris is now more relevant than ever.<br>Therefore, we will be grateful to the pilots who will help preserve outer space for future generations! We publish a list of particularly contaminated systems, you can help us by collecting all the garbage there that you can, if there is something valuable among the garbage, you, of course, have the exclusive right on it.

We are a group of <0> veteran military pilots with vast experience in combat and still languishing in civilian life, but thanks to you, we may finally have a chance to sit back at the controls of warships and show everyone what a great Maloq army is.<br>In case of successful funding, we will organize a detachment called <1> and immediately begin to provide combat support to the coalition fleet and maintain order in the territories controlled by the coalition. At the moment we are based on the planet <2> in the <3> system, from where, if successful, <4> and begin our service. That's all. At ease!<br>Raised funds: <5>/<6> cr.
        625=Hello. I will not beat around the bush for a long time, I say right away: we cannot win this war! Now let's go in order. I represent the Faeyan Research Institute of planet <0> of system <1>, better known as Research Institute "<2>". We specialize in mathematics and statistics. We have calculated all the possible scenarios for the development of events, taking into account even such unpredictable factors as: the heroism of individuals, natural disasters and social unrest caused by an increase in prices for textile products, we even took into account the principle of "One Chance in a Million", formulated by the ancient human mathematician P. Terry, in short, our results can claim to be the most complete and objective of all possible. And they are disappointing. According to our calculations, the chances of the coalition to win are now only <3>%. However, all is not lost! We've figured out that the <4> turning point can only come from a few extra warships (more specifically, <5>), my colleagues and I are ready to take on this burden, but the Ministry flatly refuses to give us the ships!<br>So now everything is in your hands, if you provide your support, then we will be able to buy and equip ships for ourselves, which in turn will bring the coalition a decisive percentage in the chances of winning. Everything is in our hands!<br>Raised funds: <6>/<7> cr.
        650=Hello. I represent a public organization <0> from planet <1> (system <2>). We are very concerned about the current situation on the military fronts. We tried to provide all possible assistance to the coalition army, primarily financial, of course, but now we understand that this is not enough. The army needs people. In our ranks there were former mercenaries, retired military officers, law enforcement officers, in a word, those who have some experience in combat operations. In total, we were able to gather <3> volunteers who would be ready to defend the coalition as militias, but, unfortunately, we don’t have ships, the necessary equipment and weapons. The army, as I already mentioned, is also going through hard times and give us ships are incapable, which is why we turn to you. If the project is successfully funded, our volunteer detachment will finally be able to do what it is intended to do - protect the lives of innocent citizens and bring victory in the war closer. The fundraiser will last until <4>.<br>Raised funds: <5>/<6> cr.

        AlrightThan_1=</color>And all this just for the sake of one hull?!<br>I'll direct the ship to the planet right now to hand over the hull to the local storage.<br>And you, by the way, could first just normally ask!
        AlrightThan_2=</color>Wow! Well, you scared me! I thought you might want to sell me into slavery, or worse, revoke my transport license!<br>I change course, start moving towards the nearest planet. Your hull, <Player>, will soon be returned to its rightful owner.
        AlrightThan_3=</color>Pah, you damned law-worshippers! Yours, mine - what's the difference? One hell of a thing tomorrow we will all die, and conditional property will lose all subjectiveness!<br>Today, however, I do not intend to die, and therefore I am heading for the nearest planet. There I will hand over your hull to the damned authorities, and then do what you want with it!
        Anyway_HowsYourSexLife_1=</color>I don't understand, why this sarcasm? I bought this case quite recently, from the hands of one honest peleng. Do you have any questions about fair dealings? Or maybe envy gnaws at the heart?
        Anyway_HowsYourSexLife_2=</color>What's the tone, colleague? The hull was received in the most honest way as a reward for successfully completing a "special importance" courier mission.<br>In fact, Princess <clr>Saar-Kazm<clrEnd> simply ran out of high-quality maloq bath foam. Well, you understand, immediately the issue of national security...<br>And what, in fact, is your unhealthy interest, you may ask?
        Anyway_HowsYourSexLife_3=</color>Please don't insinuate!<br>If you don't know, the company always provides the carriers with hulls. So I received this particular hull through the distribution system.<br>Now, excuse me, I was ordered to urgently transport <clr>40<clrEnd> tons of Earth persimmons. I'm in a hurry.
        Anyway_HowsYourSexLife_4=</color>Just don't be rude, okay! I'm an honest hard worker who was honestly lucky to win a good hull at cards.<br>And by the way, I'm taking this hull as a gift to my five-year-old daughter, so get out of the way - you're upsetting the child!
        Anyway_HowsYourSexLife_5=</color>Hey, I don’t understand, why haven’t you felt a fist in your face for a long time?! So let me arrange for you - in a first-class way, so to speak!<br>And this hull was bequeathed to me by the late grandfather - that was a good pirate... In short, the legacy of my respectable family does not concern you in any way, is it clear?! Better get out of here before I get really mad!
        Anyway_HowsYourSexLife_6=</color>Before you say one more insulting word about me, let me remind you: I - PirName - am a threat to the Coalition, and you are some pathetic, knocked-out ranger kid who thinks he has the right to accuse ME of ratting!<br>However, once if you are so interested in this hull, then know that its former owner is right now hanging like a cold corpse in the middle of outer space and, I suppose, is not too happy that he even dared to cross my path.
        DamnYou!_1=</color>Damn you, <Player>! I really wanted that hull back!<br>But you know what, fuck it. Even if I am destined to die in this battle - let the hull burn down with me rather than go to such a treacherous scoundrel like you!
        DamnYou!_2=Oh you treacherous beast! I treat you like a humanoid and you!!!<br>Get the hell out of my screen! Let me at least die, but now I won’t give up the hull for anything!
        DamnYou!_3=</color>That's what my mother told me when I was a child - don't trust cunning rangers!<br>Go to hell, <Player>, you won't get your hull! Freaks like you - straight to hell is the surest road!
        HaHaHa!WhatAStory_Mark_1=</color>Ahh! Stop! Enough!!! Stop this outrage right now - you're breaking your own ship!<br>Your large-caliber arguments have completely convinced me - I'm returning the hull to its rightful owner. There is a planet nearby - soon your hull will be in it's storage.<br>In return, I only ask you to cease fire and allow me to make a soft landing.
        HaHaHa!WhatAStory_Mark_2=</color>Ay-ay! Okay! I give up, that's enough!!! I'll give you back your hull, otherwise you'll beat me to death like that!<br>There's a planet not far away - I'll leave it on it. But just don't hit me anymore - I have to feed my family!
        HaHaHa!WhatAStory_Mark_3=</color>Hey caramba! I give up! White flag - capitulation!<br>You got me, nit - take your damn hull! I'm watching a planet nearby - I'll drop it there.<br>You only, most importantly, hide your gun so that you're out of harm's way!
        HeckYouAsshole_1=</color>If you stick with me, you'll get punched in the face. The first and last warning.
        HeckYouAsshole_2=</color>Fuck you, goat!
        HeckYouAsshole_3=</color>Are you completely insolent!? Well, get off the monitor - ugly mug!
        IDidntHitHer_1=</color>Ah, <Player> is that you? I'm looking for you in all the systems, I'm already tired!<br>I couldn't do the transfer normally, sorry for that, but I'll return the hull right now.<br>Follow me.
        IDidntHitHer_2=</color>Well, okay, okay, you caught me, I confess - I was wrong.<br>In general, you seem to be a normal guy, so I'll give you your hull right now.<br>Come follow me!
        IDidntHitHer_3=</color>You did find me, didn't you?<br>Ah, to hell with debt! To get into ranger affairs - it will be more expensive for me<br>I will return your hull, so be it! Come on, follow along.
        IDidntHitHer_4=</colorDamn, I knew that I would get caught - scam didn’t work out! Forgive me, I'm a fool - I wanted to quickly clean up the money. They've been paying mere crumbs lately!<br>In short, here's a planet not far away - there I'll give you your hull. Let's go!
        IDidntHitHer_5=</color>Ugh, ranger mongrel! Sniffed out my trail! Well, okay, don't get excited - I'll return your trough to you. Look, you see the planet? I'll drop it there.<br>And you fly after me, if you don't believe me.
        IDidntHitHer_6=</color>Oh, it's a pity - agent rats leaked me! So then trust these bribe-takers!<br>Well, what are you looking at?! We drove to the nearest planet - there I will throw off your pelvis.
        IGiveUp_1=</color>Well, well, well - you won! Stop this firing, I'm already changing course.<br>I'll leave your hull on the nearest planet, and you, if you want, fly after me.
        IGiveUp_2=</color>Ugh! If only you could fall through to the Klissans, ranger!<br>Well, I'll give you the hull! There, there is a planet nearby - fly after me.
        IGiveUp_3=</color>A-argh! I hate you! I hate everyone!!!<br>I'll give you back your hull, you bastard! Do you see the planet? I'll drop your hull on it.<br>Fly after you!
        Oh_hiMark_1=</color>Well, how do you like the stolen hull?
        Oh_hiMark_2=</color>Hey, fucking hermit crab, didn't you make a mistake with the hull?
        Oh_hiMark_3=</color>Listen, you have a beautiful hull! Saved for a long time, I suppose?

        1=The Gaalians were the first to encounter the Klissans, many hundreds of years before their contact with the other races of the Coalition. At that time, the Gaalian civilization did not consider insatiability a sign of barbarism, and self-knowledge and moderation a trait of wisdom, and was actively pursuing galactic expansion. Having mastered many worlds in neighboring sectors, the Gaalians wanted to reach the neighboring spiral arm of the Galaxy. This was considered virtually impossible, since entering and exiting hyperspace is only possible where the continuum is curved by the gravity of particularly massive objects, such as stars, and the more energy a ship expends between the two curvature zones, the greater the distance separating them, to "pierce" the continuum. But there are countless parsecs of emptiness between the spiral arms; to pierce them in one go would require energy on the order of a star. Of course, one could also fly in a spiral, first along one arm toward the center of the galaxy, then along the other arm back-but such a path is too long even for the Gaalians. However, the Gaalians have discovered the technology to create stable "bubbles" of curved space, capable of moving independently of the mass that generated them. In such a "bubble" it is possible to travel to virtually any point in space.
        2=Thus the Gaalians reached the neighboring arm and established the first colonies in the star system they called Eltan. From there the expansion progressed successfully until one of the flotillas exploring the second arm encountered the Mahpella by chance. The Machpella was a giant intelligent ship, the product of non-biological evolution. The Mahpella traveled from star to star, surrounded by a fleet of smaller "ships," the Klissans, subordinate to it. The first attempt at contact ended tragically - the Klissans destroyed the Gaal expedition. Thus began a war in which the Gaalians suffered one defeat after another. Not only Fleet crews perished-the Mahpella and the Klissans destroyed all life on the colonized planets.
        3=The Gaalians, who remained in our arm, escaped the danger, but the shock they experienced had an impact on the entire future history of their civilization. The idea of space expansion lost popularity dramatically. Bubble technology was banned and classified. The intellectual toll was great as well - many scientists rushed to the second arm, to the forefront of the unexplored, and were now dead.
        4=Over the past centuries, the Gaalians have recovered somewhat, begun to explore space again, made contact with the Faey, the Peleng, the Maloq, and the humans, and helped create the Galactic Council. And then, three hundred years ago, when it seemed that a lasting peace had finally been achieved, Rachean ruined everything. He was one of the best commanders in the Peleng fleet, but he was outmaneuvered and decided to become a pirate. At first, however, he worked in intelligence and managed to extract from the Gaalians an archive of which they themselves no longer remembered. From there he learned both the secret of the "bubbles" and about Machpella. He assumed, and as it turned out, correctly, that there were in fact many Machpellas. True, at first he didn't need Mahpella - the "bubble" was enough to pirate all the space he had explored with impunity, suddenly appearing in any place and disappearing again in hyperspace.
        5=But then the anti-terrorist forces of the five civilizations managed to trap and defeat the pirate fleet. Rachekhan, however, managed to escape in his own ship. And so he decided to fly to the next arm, find Machpella and either defeat her, thereby gaining some kind of superweapon, or, if that didn't work, set her against the combined galactic forces. Of course, he couldn't do the first, but he did the second: Machpella and the Klissans, chasing him, were caught in the other arm.
        6=The second war didn't fare much better than the first-the five civilizations fought the Klissans better than one, but still gradually lost. That's when the first bet was made on the Rangers, in the hope that the small autonomous ships would be able to do what the big fleets couldn't - get close to the Mahpella and destroy it. Yes, the military has always thought only of how to destroy the enemy, without even trying to understand his motives. Fortunately, there were plenty of scientists who thought otherwise. And among the rangers there was one smart enough to use scientific developments to establish contact with Mahpella<br>. And then it turned out that in fact she did not wish any harm! The Mahpella race is inorganic, they originated directly in space, in the gas-dust nebula; their bodies are a number of small crystalline elements, differently organized in the energy field. The Klissans are not actually subordinates or children of Mahpella, as originally thought, but simply her remotely controlled organs, which Mahpella can cultivate in large quantities. Machpellas travel through space, feeding off the energy of the stars, and have never been particularly interested in planets. All the more so because once they landed on a planet, they got an infection there in the form of the local simplest life forms, which, multiplying, destroyed the crystals of the Machpellas. So, both the first and second Mahpella, when they encountered the spacecraft, mistook them for their sentient counterparts, and their crews for organic parasites. The Mahpellas had no idea that organic life could be intelligent and, naturally, immediately began to fight the spread of a deadly epidemic.

        1=<clr>Faey<clrEnd> are a race of hermaphrodite humanoids that inhabit the Aylai branch and adjacent sectors. The Feyans are an intelligent civilization, characterized by the highest level of natural intelligence. The priority of intelligence and peaceful values has made the Faeyan race a highly developed humanitarian society. Faeyans are responsible for a significant number of Coailtion research projects and play a crucial role in the Union's research policy.
        10=<clr>Internal Conflicts in Faeyan History<clrEnd>: Interesting and noteworthy is the fact that for a very long time the concept of weapons was unknown to Faeyan civilization. The strong humanitarian content of Faeyan culture is the reason for the absolute absence of traditional wars involving weapons of physical elimination. While the number of cities and autonomous villages varied at different stages of development, conflicts between them never escalated into clashes for the purpose of mutual destruction.<br>The only death of a Dalani and his cronies occurred when emissaries of the opposing city accused him of stupidity (the greatest vice for Faeyans) and he, putting his life as collateral, lost a contest of wits (eylaki) and killed himself, although his subjects asked him not to. As a result, his opponent was found superior to him in ayon (mind), and was accepted as the new dalani. This single case of death by political confrontation occurred at an early stage of development, when there were as yet no organized forms of "arbitration of the mind. In all other cases of conflict everything was resolved by intellectual disputes (ayollita), when the opponents spent time in discussion and reflection. Then both would admit that one of them was superior and wiser than the other, and so the conflict was over.
        11=<clr>Interracial Relations<clrEnd>: The first race Faeyans encountered in space was the Gaal. The Faey space fleets that came into contact with the Gaal civilization were completely unarmed, and the initial relationship between the two peoples was strained but not belligerent. The turning point in the approach to building fleets occurred when one after another, several centuries apart, the Faey encountered first the Maloq and then the Peleng civilizations.<br>Having recorded intelligent activity at one of the Maloq outposts, Faeyans sent emissaries to it, which were destroyed. Immediately following that, hordes of Maloq drakkar attacked the outer radii of the Faey race, completely unarmed. The first casualties were devastating. It was not difficult for the Faey to construct weapons and, thanks to Aionic techniques, to formulate tactical science in a speculative and completely a priori fashion. Wars with the vastly outnumbered Maloq forces continued for a long time with varying success.<br>When aggressive action followed from the Peleng race, the Faeyans already possessed excellent battle fleets and repelled the Lepras' attacks without loss. It was only with the formation of the Galactic Coalition that the conflicts finally ceased.
        12=<clr>Galactic Politics<clrEnd>: Politically, the Faey civilization is united in what is known as the Onakan Registry, a confederative political body. The ambassador to the Galactic Council is elected from among the outstanding and most respected Dalani scholars. The main role and direct responsibility of the Faey in the Coailtion is research projects and directions. It was the Faey institutions that conducted and completed in 2882 the fundamental research on the so-called "black holes" (actually mole holes) that led to the creation of zero-transition technology and combat prototypes of the modern vortex searchlight.<br>The shared cultural proximity of Faey and Humans ensured a certain integration of these races. While some cultural peculiarities suggest strong, sometimes irreconcilable differences between the two civilizations, integration processes prevail, and humans and Faey constructively cooperate in many areas.<br>In the direction of the former enemies of the Maloq and Peleng, the Faey political line has traditionally been restrained, if not negative. Both races have waged intense spying campaigns aimed at mastering Faey technology. The Faey administration is wary of the expansionist policies of the Maloq, who have already taken over parts of the native Faey sector of Islay. In addition, both the Maloqs and Pelengs have an implicit (and often overt) dislike for the Faey because of their hermaphroditism.
        13=<clr>Economic characteristics<clrEnd>: There is a serious economic problem with food. The extreme rarity, even uniqueness, of neon organic food, which is essential to the Faey race and only grows on Eipentak, has generated extremely intense research into food technology. Because of the extreme difficulty of planting neonic organics on the soil of alien planets, they are in high demand. The Faey industry is also developing another line of research--neon-adaptation of flora, which involves genetically modifying the food of other races to produce neon forms in the next generations. All this requires a huge resource and information investment. The problem of a guaranteed food supply for the Faey race is still unresolved, creating obvious obstacles to the colonization of new worlds.<br>Faey governments prohibit the trade of drugs, alcohol, and weapons, which are traditionally unpleasant for Faeyn.
        2=<clr>Biological characteristics of the species<clrEnd>: Faeyans belong to the humanoid class, but because of their hermaphroditism and unconventional brain and respiratory tract structure they are also called semi-humanoids. They breathe a neon-containing air mixture, which explains the predominant purple hue of their bodies; their foodstuffs include the traditional neon organics of the Eyepentak.<br>Unique paradox of the Faeyan brain and eye structure, called the phenomenon of divided consciousness, is that the Faeyan can arbitrarily divide consciousness and facial vision into sections that function entirely independently, and thus form an arbitrary number of autonomously and independently functioning areas of consciousness responsible for their own vision.
        3=<clr>Origin of civilization<clrEnd>: The cradle of the Faey race is the planet Eipentak at the center of the Aylai branch. With an atmosphere of noble gases and unique neon flora and fauna, this planet gave rise to a distinctive Faey culture centered on reason in all its manifestations. Constant search and analysis of information, improvement of thinking techniques, various schools and traditions of consciousness made this culture, on the one hand, dynamic and mobile, and on the other - extremely immune to attempts to reform it from the outside. Feyang society can easily and in a short time rebuild itself, but it hardly succumbs to attempts to change it by other cultures.<br>Ani ayon is a cultural phenomenon and a philosophy of existence. There was no traditional period of archaism and nomadic forms in the development of Feyang civilization. From the very beginning of their history, the Faeyans grouped around the most enlightened leaders, the Dalani. They took on functions resembling the traditional functions of rulers, but also different from them. This is how ethnic groups and the first states were formed.<br>The first dalani and were the founders of the first classical ani ayon ("life of the mind") - schools, or traditions, of thought technique (in the common galactic translated terminology, "ayonic systems"). The first such systems were merely summaries of the basic principles of a particular approach to the mind and its functioning. Subsequently they acquired more and more complete scientific outlines, methodologies were formed, and the number of followers and researchers expanded. The history of the Ani Aion in the complex of their manifestations, in their coexistence and mutual influence is the history of the Fayan culture. It was the ayonic schools, clothed in forms of cohabitation of disciples, that first became villages, later, in more perfect forms, cities and states. Thus mind became the most important priority and object of improvement, and information and the means of obtaining it became the main category of all relations between individuals and groups.
        4=<clr>Intangible Culture<clrEnd>: Speaking of Faeyan intangible culture, what is primarily meant is not a system of unproductive product with a playful beginning, but again the results and goals of mental perfection. The Faeyans created beautiful monuments of ayonic literature and painting, which were essentially the methodology of certain ayonic systems and were created by the Dalani and their disciples. Such literature and painting, as judged by human art historians, also contain artistic value. Today both aionic videography, theater, and virtual art forms exist and flourish, although they are not traditional Faey, and arose as a result of the synthesis of Faey and human cultures.<br>Unlike humans, however, Faey are alien to the acute inner perception of beauty as a superpsychic phenomenon. Their mind, their consciousness, is far more pragmatic and at times even cynical than that of humans. They are more rational and therefore less inclined to perceive beauty, which is by nature irrational. The problems of unproductive culture in the system of Aionic philosophies are now being developed by the joint Faey-Human Institute for the Development of Mind on Umartanish, joint cultural projects are being undertaken by the Ela Aiona Cultra and Euro-Kinematon concerns.<br>Faeyan culture, best expressed in the historical homeland of Aipentaka, has traditionally attracted the attention of researchers and tourists. The biotowns of Elmanti and Ansa, the Mind Development Institute on Umartanish, the flying kunkan farms in the Aiproti Valley - have become tourist sites of galactic proportions. On Aipentak, all elements of traditional Faey culture are carefully preserved. At the same time, on the more distant Faey planets a more international, cosmopolitan way of life prevails.
        5=<clr>Statehood and Humanoidal Values<clrEnd>: Traditional Feyan historiography divides the history of the development of its civilization into three stages, or paths: the free path, the path of authority, and the onnaraika (the path of the new horizon). These are very distinctive, purely Faeyan forms of political organization that have survived almost unchanged to this day. They did not always follow each other in chronological order and often overlapped each other in time. The reason for the change of these forms was the political will of the leading Dalani. All three forms are characterized by their own arsenals of information-political means and their own systems of ani ayon, and therefore require separate consideration.
        6=<clr>The free way<clrEnd>: The Initial Phase of Development, the Faeyan analogue of anarchism. In the usual sense, anarchism as a powerless form of cohabitation is not peculiar to Faeyan culture for the reason that disorder as such is not peculiar to them. For the first millennia Faey villages existed autonomously, each of them developing its own ayonic system and its own dialect. There were also economic forms of interaction. The Faeyans moved freely, freely forming new cities. There was no centralization of power. In common galactic terminology the "free way" is typical anarchism, but it is a distinctive Faeyan version of anarchism. With some modifications it still exists today on many Faey planets.
        7=<clr>The path of the authorities<clrEnd>: This path is a Faeyan version of the republican system and differs from the previous form only in the centralization of power in the hands of prominent Dalani and the new scale of economic relations. When the way of the authorities in its traditional form established itself in most of the Faeyan cities, there was a sharp demographic and economic growth, and the aionic systems took on the features of independent scientific disciplines. It was during this period that dynamically gaining momentum technology made it possible to make a breakthrough into space.
        8=<clr>Onnaraika (the path of new horizons)<clrEnd>: In Aionic systems this path appears as a unique form of coexistence of the universal and the earthly, the public and the private, while from a galactic perspective it is a confederative ideocratic democracy with a shared right to possess information. This form of civilization emerged with the emergence of interplanetary fragmentation and its essence is difficult to comprehend for those who are only superficially familiar with Faey culture. In the most general terms, it is a democracy with state-controlled information flows, where each citizen possesses only the information he or she needs to be of maximum benefit to society.
        9=<clr>Traditional Infrastructure<clrEnd>: Economically the Faeyan states were quite homogeneous, which is explained by the relative similarity of the natural resources of the Eipentak. Traditionally, soft and ungraded subsoil rocks were mined, and applied neon flora products were created. Eipentak is relatively poor in minerals, and the neon plant organisms that serve as food for the Faey grow so slowly that it necessitated the development of special farming industries. The cities exchanged food and minerals, the most liquid commodities after information.

        1=<clr>Gaal<clrEnd> are a race of tailed humanoid aproids inhabiting the Ona-Ota branch and having colonies in the inaccessible hyperjump center of the Galaxy. The Gaalians are the most ancient, most powerful, and least known civilization of the Coailtion. Its roots go back to the early history of the formation of galactic star systems and are lost in the chronicles of the Ooglans, the first humanoids.
        2=<clr>Biological characteristics of the species<clrEnd>: The Gaals are the last of the humanoids to retain their tails, or otherwise aproids. They are covered with light blonde hair, breathe nitrogen mixtures, and feed on organic matter, which is obtained by molecular synthesis. The Gaals are the direct descendants of the legendary OOglans, who mysteriously disappeared millions of years ago.
        3=<clr>Origins and Loss of Homeworld<clrEnd>: If the existing chronicles are to be believed, the history of the Gaal civilization begins several billion years ago in the globular galaxy of Allir. These chronicles are preserved on the relic comet Fali in an ancient telepathic language used by the proto-civilizations of Ooglan and Vaa, and are called the Fali chronicles. Passed down to the Gaalians from the depths of time, they tell not only the history of the Gaal people, but also of what was long before their appearance.<br>The Ooglans, the first known humanoids (tailed aproids), as well as the telepathic Waa people, lived in the Allir galaxy for several million years. Both races were as ancient as the galaxy itself, and possessed a vast knowledge of the nature of space and time.<br>While the Vaa were content with the limits of the home galaxy, the Ooglans were pioneers and actively colonized deep space. Several settlements were also formed in the young spiral galaxy, then called Ulli-aera. These colonies developed safely for a long time, until a catastrophe occurred that permanently severed the Ooglan colonists' ties with the home galaxy of Allir.<br>Until recently, the cause of this catastrophe was unknown. For unexplained reasons, the colonists in the Ulli-aera galaxy lost communication (telepathic and transport) with the home world of Allir.<br>The delivery of cargo and information stopped, and the Ooglan colonists were left to their own devices - on planets new to them, in unfamiliar conditions, with a minimum of resources and knowledge. The isolation caused the regression of the great Ooglan civilization, which began with the loss of many of the colonists' technologies and ended in the oblivion of their roots. Forever cut off from their home, colonial in its history, but already completely independent in its essence, the colonists' society adapted to the new conditions began to call itself Gaal. Thus began one of the first inhabitants of the young galaxy Ulli-aera, a new, distinctive civilization, which was to grow along with its galaxy and see the formation and fall of many peoples.
        4=<clr>Early Colonial History<clrEnd>: The Gaalians initially possessed several star systems. Their technology was far inferior to that originally possessed by the Ooglans, and for many millennia Gaal could not even match the technological and informational resources of their ancestors.<br>Early Gaal society was quasi-colonial - possessing several systems, which were essentially typical colonies, it evolved to eliminate the shortcomings of colonialism and assimilate to life on new planets. Gaal's colonization policy was directed toward the center of the Galaxy, toward the gas clusters where, according to legends, the ancient relict Ooglan planets might have been located. The Ooglan pioneers always created such planets where the climate was unsuitable for conversion and adaptation, and placed capsules on them with messages and navigational instructions for reaching the Allir worlds. Only by finding the relic planets with their information could the Gaalians hope to discover the causes of the disaster that cut them off from their world and their people. But millennia passed, and no such planets were found, either in the outer arms or in the center of the galaxy. Gradually, the historical memory of the Gaalians was increasingly superseded by new realities, and the knowledge of who the Ooglans were and why they arrived in the Galaxy gradually took on the features of legend until it finally disappeared. The fact that relic planets existed was found to be untrue. The appearance, language and way of life of the Gaalians changed; the new civilization was in a new reality and solved new problems.<br>It was in the search for the relic planets that the general line of colonization was formed - to the center of the Galaxy. The principle of movement was not in hypertransition, but in linear motion with multiple deceleration of the time function - an art rather than a technology that the Gaalians mastered perfectly. In the progressive exploration of stellar systems Gaal also met the original inhabitants of the Galaxy who had been living in the central regions for thousands of years - the liquid-gaseous life form Nyla, filling the atmospheres and oceans of numerous gas giants; the spore-dwelling Oldpra people; subsequently the ancient Bader civilization, once powerful but having lost its instinct for self-preservation and therefore doomed to constant regression, was also discovered. They were peace-loving civilizations without wars; Gaal, itself a destructive potential, but an enlightened enough people, entered into a constructive dialogue with them. It was a partnership of equals, and coexistence had its benefits.
        5=<clr>Invasion of the Klingons<clrEnd>: The period of temporary prosperity lasted until suddenly a catastrophe shook the galaxy that overturned the entire established world. The Klingons, a hierarchical, uncivilized life-form whose only raison d'etre was to destroy and consume, invaded from the outer reaches. Negotiations were unsuccessful and proved pointless; the Klingas methodically seized one planet after another until the Oldpra and Nyla races were completely destroyed. Bader was at first far from the advance of the Klinges, and Gaal, with its rich culture and a mighty war machine never before used for its intended purpose, stood in the way of the aggressor...<br>Later, in studying the remains of the planets captured by the Klingas, the Gaalians would come to a staggering conclusion: the Klingas are not a civilization, not a race, and not even a cohabitation of individuals; they are only a form of gene structure, artificially raised to the level of possession of consciousness. Klinges are a phenomenon created by a distant cosmos or by a higher intelligence itself for the sole purpose of testing sentient peoples for their ability to survive. But was it a lesson or a verdict?<br>Gaal was methodically exterminated. It was useless to build huge fleets, for the inexplicable paradox was that it was large fleets that the Klingons exterminated with astonishing ease. This dependence was frightening in its absurdity. The Bader people came to their aid, and were crushed but not completely destroyed due to their remoteness.<br>This could have ended in disaster for the surviving inhabitants of the galaxy if not for the unexpected support of the Va'a, the ancient friends of the Ooglans. They informed the Gaalians of the details of ancient events: the Kling invasion of Allir, the resistance and fall of the Ooglan civilization, the long but effective resistance by the Vaa, and the displacement of the Klingons toward the cluster of galaxies, which included what the Ooglan pioneers called Ulli-aera. The Va'a followed the Klingons to finally defeat them, who posed the greatest threat to reason itself. But, as it turned out, the complete destruction of the Klingas was beyond anyone's power, and the Va'a merely forced them to leave the galaxy, after which they left as well. That was the end of Gaal's link with the Va'a, and the Gaal civilization was once again to rise from the ruins.
        6=<clr>Relationship with Races of the Coalition<clrEnd>: As time passed, the galaxy gradually began to fill with life again. Cyclical universal laws led to the emergence of new humanoid forms. Gaal incognito watched young civilizations develop on the outermost reaches of the Galaxy; when they emerged stronger and expressed a desire to integrate and build their world together, Gaal had nothing against joining. But the ancient wisdom and experience of millions of years did not allow him to open all the doors at once to those who have just embarked on the thorny path of knowledge of universal truths. Only when the situation demanded it did the Gaalians intervene; usually they stood aside, allowing the young races to make common, but much-needed mistakes.<br>A relict planet of the pioneer Ooglans was discovered; or rather, it was a comet with a rotation period of 1500 years, the icy comet Fali. Relict knowledge was read and checked against what Gaal had learned from Vaa, and the chronicles of the exodus of the Ooglans from Allir and the subsequent demise of the home world were reconstructed.<br>The new cosmic peoples know only what the latter allow them to know about the Gaal civilization; so far no modern race is able to make proper use of the knowledge that Gaal has accumulated over millions of years. When that time comes and the new humanoids have gained maturity and experience, when their minds are ready to perceive the ancient knowledge of the Ooglans, Vaa and Gaal, it will happen organically and naturally.<br>Today Gaal maintains friendly relations with the races of the Galactic Coailtion, common markets have been created according to the Charter, educational and tourist complexes have opened on the Riolka and Proon planets. Detailed information about political structures is not disclosed, though in general Gaal has diplomatic missions and adheres to positions of peaceful development. Minerals of different nature and properties are actively procured and used by Gaalians for molecular operations, mostly for food.
        7=<clr>Economic Specificity<clrEnd>: A separate problem of civilization is the high level of Gaal-specific addiction. It is what is known as intellectual chemical addiction, in which special drugs are used to enhance one's mental capabilities. By means of molecular engineering, the Gaalians obtain all kinds of chemicals from the commonly available drugs bought on the black markets. There are already known links between Gaalian and human drug barons, Maloqca suppliers and Pelengian smugglers. This network is so widespread and powerful that in the near future to shake its position hardly seem possible, although the united galactic special structures are actively working in this direction.<br>Gaal markets, full of high-tech and inexpensive products, are very popular throughout the Coailtion. Wherever a high level of technology and reliability is required, combined with affordability and low price, Gaal brands are beyond competition. It is Gaal that supplies the markets with cheap and high quality medical products obtained by molecular synthesis, any technology, including organic and informational, as well as, illegally, weapons.

        1=<clr>Maloq<clrEnd> are a humanoid race that has occupied vast swathes of the Galaxy. The Maloq race has made impressive advances in military and colonization, while their technological development has undergone a long stagnation. The Maloqs are known for their stamina, high reproductive capacity, asceticism and distrust of intellectual values.<br>Today the Maloqs play a leading role in Coailtion colonization policy, but their strained relationship with the Faey race often hinders the processes of galactic integration.
        2=<clr>Biological characteristics of the species<clrEnd>: The Maloq are a member of the class of oxygen-breathing humanoids and are referred to as orthodal humanoids. This type of creature is characterized by physical strength and resistance to external natural factors, low-active thought activity, and almost absolute omnivorousness. Such qualities allow Maloqs to maintain high vitality and reproductive capacity even in the most unfavorable habitats.
        3=<clr>The birth of civilization and the role of climate<clrEnd>: The Maloq civilization was born in the harsh climate of the stony planet Ramgatru. Lacking sufficient resources, the poorly lit planet did not have sufficient conditions to thrive, and the Maloq tribes did not develop any political or cultural forms for thousands of years. The environment contributed only to the preservation of the species, while development was extremely slow and often reversed. The archaic nomadic groups of the Maloq were in constant warfare, which further hindered the progress of their civilization.
        4=<clr>The cult of strength as the dominant civilization<clrEnd>: The first rartans gave themselves entirely to the numerous wars that all the early history of the Maloque rartans consisted of. In essence, the rartan, the traditional form of Malokan statehood whose echoes are still present in their political system, is nothing less than the authority of the strongest warrior over the rest.<br>The entire system of subordination was built on the authority of strength and courage. Strength and the art of warfare were the traditional main positive features of Malayoq culture. The weak and infirm were despised, and at the dawn of history there was even a practice of killing the elderly and disabled.
        5=<clr>Formation of states and the dynastic age<clrEnd>: With the emergence of state formations, writing and the first material discoveries, the Maloqa civilization followed the path of strengthening the authority of the rartan, increasing the rartan and developing new forms of suppression of internal and external enemies.<br>The political form remained and remains unchanged - unlimited or almost unlimited power of the ruler.
        6=<clr>Interracial relations<clrEnd>: The Space Age, for objective reasons, began rather late - after many millennia of slow and thorny development. The main reason for Maloqs to search for new worlds was the extreme overpopulation of Ramgatru.<br>Their ability to adapt to almost any conditions enabled them to rapidly expand their colonial borders, even though they were unfamiliar with bioassimilation and landscape transformation technologies. Even without these, however, the Maloq race was able to take root on the harshest and most hostile planets.
        7=<clr>Political and cultural environment<clrEnd>: At its current stage of development, the Maloq civilization is a vast territory made up of independent rartan planets, united in the deliberative body of Argote. A huge armed fleet is still being formed and maintained, and intensive colonization is underway.
        8=<clr>Specifics of the Maloq economy<clrEnd>: For traditional reasons, Maloqs use very few minerals in construction and other fields. At the same time, however, they mine them in large quantities for export, as minerals are in high demand by other races of the Coailtion.<br>Due to the lack of advanced public medicine, the Maloqs are in dire need of imported medicines. Armaments and equipment are traditionally in high demand.

        1=<clr>Pelengs<clrEnd> are a race of amphibians that inhabit the lower reaches of the Gurg Belt. The Peleng are notorious for their destructive politics, espionage and piracy. Not an intellectually oriented race, the Peleng are technologically underdeveloped but are constantly adding to their scientific resources through espionage.<br>Pelengs have no diplomatic or trade relations and only formally participate in Coailtion bodies.
        2=<clr>Biological characteristics of the species<clrEnd>: The Peleng race refers to a species of toadfish amphibians, commonly referred to as leprasians. This species is equally well adapted to living in both liquid and terrestrial environments, and is able to breathe any gas mixtures that include small amounts of nitrogen. Like all lepras, the food of pelengi is acidic plankton and fecal reef sediments.
        3=<clr>The origin of the civilization<clrEnd>: The Peleng Oceanic Civilization originates in the liquid acid environment of the minor planet Rakhish in the center of the Gurg Belt. The fauna of Rakhish is a unique system of its kind, the main feature of which is the phenomenal Leprasian animal forms with different levels of intelligence development.
        4=<clr>The Leprasian phenomenon and its role in the formation of the Peleng civilization<clrEnd>: As a biological and social phenomenon, Leprasian forms have been studied for a long time. In fact, leprasians are amphibians united by almost identical body structure but completely different levels of mental development. They all have the same physiology and are so similar in appearance that one would not be able to tell them apart upon superficial observation. In the meantime, they are completely different species, as can be seen if only from the fact that the crossing of species results in sterile hybrids.<br>In terms of intelligence, the lepracial forms also vary from primitive animals to completely intelligent beings. For example, glamigids, the most undeveloped of the lepraces, are incapable of any instrumental activity, communication, or any form of social coexistence. Fumia lacus already have the rudiments of articulation and are capable of communicating through gestures. Fumia prodonts have developed articulation, use instruments, and build reef buildings. Dradans and Riptungs, nearly intelligent forms, have developed language, settle in settlements in groups, and develop materially and culturally. The Pelengi are the only complete sentient form of Leprasians that inhabit Rakhish. The entire history of the formation and development of the Peleng civilization is due to their interaction with their less intelligent counterparts.
        5=<clr>Specifics of Peleng statehood<clrEnd>: Over time, the Pelengs developed state forms, which at first were classical despotisms. Discipline was rigid, which was necessary for waging numerous wars. However, the wars were easy, as the Pelengs were initially confronted by rather undeveloped peoples, mostly Luce and Zang. The results of these wars were more cultural than economic - they sharpened the Peleng mentality's sense of overwhelming superiority over other sentient beings. The Pelengs developed an abhorrence of their lesser brethren, who became merely objects of harassment and robbery to the former, with the result that robbery and plunder of lesser leprassians came to be seen as a natural and even honorable occupation. In some regions cannibalism gained momentum, with the Pelengs using inferior Lepras (mostly Glamigids and Lus) as food. And since the physiological boundary between pelengi and other species is very conditional, it was easy to prove when killing a pelengi that the victim was not a pelengi at all. As a result, the very notion of crime became very shaky in the Peleng culture. The right of force began to prevail over the law, the principle of profit and convenience over the principle of humanity.
        6=<clr>Interracial relations<clrEnd>: The attitude of the Pelengs to other sentient beings they encountered in space was at first the same as that of the Rakhish Shrakan. The image of an equal sentient being, a partner being, simply did not fit the Peleng mind.<br>When the Pelengs encountered a Faey diplomatic cortege, it attacked it out of habit, and was defeated. Requests by the Faey for negotiations yielded nothing, and the ensuing war continued until outnumbering Faey forces left the Pelengs in a hopeless position. An ultimatum was delivered, and the Pelengs accepted unconditional surrender for the first time.<br>Thus began a new stage in the confrontation - black diplomacy, espionage, and legalized piracy. The notorious Peleng lyakusha took on a new quality and cosmic scale.
        7=<clr>Administrative and economic conditions<clrEnd>: The Peleng planets coordinate their actions in a rather weak Shazikhmin body (usually translated as "great gorge"). The authority granted to the Shazihmin is small, which explains the incoherence and instability of Peleng's politics as a cosmic civilization. The politics of individual planets and their leaders play a major role. Internal wars are not uncommon either, with planets forming hostile camps and armed conflicts breaking out between them. In such cases, the Galactic Council prefers to stand aside.
        8=<clr>Foreign Policy<clrEnd>: Peleng's attempt to bridge the technological gap lies in its advanced system of industrial espionage. The Peleng Dzuhallag Office is the best, if that word is allowed here, espionage and sabotage agency in the entire Coailtion. Dzuhallag's industrial and informational special operations plague Faey, Human and Gaalian governments alike.<br>Through technological espionage, the Pelengs manage to maintain a relatively good level of technology; they also actively resell stolen informational resources to Maloqs.

        1=<clr>Humanity<clrEnd> is a race of humanoids that inhabit the areas from the Wasteland to the Montel Confederate Territory. Humanity conducts active diplomatic work in all departments of the Coalition and is responsible for coordinating the work of its departments, in particular, the Galactic Council, as well as for peace initiatives.<br>This is a race focused primarily on humanitarian and cultural values. Humans are also developed politically.
        10=<clr>Export of Human Culture:<clrEnd> Humanity has given modern galactic civilization a notion of culture as an unproductive form of activity with a playful content that is generally unfamiliar to other intelligent races. Humans have contributed and popularized such phenomena as tourism, theater and videographer, romantic fiction, virtual games. Unfortunately, human culture has also brought negative things with it, such as alcoholic drinks and gambling, which have become popular on all planets of the Coalition. Traditionally excellent quality alcoholic beverages of humans are still in great demand on human planets. There is a fight against huge flows of drug smuggling.
        2=<clr>Biological features of the species: <clrEnd> Humans belong to the class of oxygen-breathing humanoids and are characterized as proto-humanoids. They are of medium height, equally developed both physically and mentally, eat organic protein food. The heterogeneity of climatic regimes on most inhabited planets (especially the solar system) is reflected in strong national differences, expressed primarily in skin color and facial features.
        3=<clr>Birth of Civilization:<clrEnd> The original human culture originates on the planet Earth, which is mostly covered in water. The fragmentation of land areas and the highly rugged landscape of the planet caused a very noticeable fragmentation between human groups, especially at the initial stage of development.
        4=<clr>The Development of Monarchism and Globalization:<clrEnd> Over time, tribal forms began to die out and be replaced by larger national entities. If in primitive tribal collectives the eldest member of the tribe was the ruler, then in larger national collectives more clear and formalized forms of power appeared. Countries (states) arose - groups whose members were united by a certain commonality of national characteristics. Politically, such countries were at first despotisms, later monarchies began to take shape.
        5=<clr><td=right>The irrational in human culture: <clrEnd> In the culture of human civilization, a significant role has been played and is still playing a fun, playful part. All social groups had their own forms of idle activity, derived from their specific cultural characteristics.<br>An important place was occupied by luxury, which became the hallmark of the ruling class and an object of desire for the less well-off strata. Alcohol is also a kind of luxury - an exclusively human invention, adopted and established by other races. Cultural forms of luxury such as videographer, fiction and virtual games are not understood by all races, but humans continue to popularize their entertainment culture, and this policy has already proven to be an effective tool for promoting good neighborly relations and cultural integration. After the Earth's natural satellite, the Moon, was turned into a giant park, this was reflected not only in astronomical income, but also in a noticeable warming of the political atmosphere.
        6=<clr>The Age of Star Wars and the First Alliances:<clrEnd> The history of Humanity's race relations began with the meeting of Faey. Both races quickly saw how similar their cultures, priorities and value systems were, and cooperation in all areas began to pick up pace. The logic and mentality of people and feyans turned out to be very close - this, as well as a common desire for knowledge, and a passion for intellectual self-improvement.
        7=<clr>Racial Peace Policy Begins:<clrEnd> Over time, human diplomacy and the principles of law began to play a leading role in the galaxy. The entire prehistory of the emergence of the Galactic Coalition is the history of the consistent work of human diplomacy to ease tensions. Being excellent psychologists and diplomats, people began to develop a policy of "racial peace". This policy, formulated in the period of the early Faey-Human alliance and having proven itself well, was to establish clear rights and obligations for each side, to develop economic and cultural ties, as well as to maintain dialogue on a regular basis. Such was the relationship of people with the Faeyans. When the confrontation with pelengs gained strength and the aggressive Peleng-Maloq bloc arose, human diplomacy began to look for ways to eliminate two opposing alliances and form a single union on their basis, where everyone would have equal rights and the benefits from which would be obvious to everyone participants.
        8=<clr>Formation of the Galactic Coalition:<clrEnd> All of the previously described events finally cleared the way for human efforts to build a clear system of galactic law. These attempts first took shape with the introduction in 2705 of the Galaxy Congress, a deliberative department of all five races that discussed economic and cultural cooperation. Because individual conflicts were still going on, a galactic confederation called the Galactic Coalition was formed in 2750. The Charter of the Coalition was based on the principles of human law, and human diplomatic institutions formed the basis of the union departments. Unified credit systems and a single chronological scale were introduced (again, the human chronological system began to serve it, "from the birth of Christ").
        9=<clr>Domestic Politics and Diplomatic Role:<clrEnd> The Confederate civilization of humans today is a pluralistic society, where a variety of political forms are united and very organized in coordinating their actions in the Confederate Senate. Political regimes on individual planets can change with some shocks, but completely bloodless. There are also larger administrative formations that pass along the borders of entire star systems (the Solar League of States, the federal districts of Ursula and Montel, the Principality of Annoir).

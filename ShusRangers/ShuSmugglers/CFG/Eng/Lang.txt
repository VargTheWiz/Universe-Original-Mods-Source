            TransportFear2=As soon as I heard your proposal - I wanted to write poetry, grow plants ... in general, do anything, just not to listen to your crazy ideas.
            TransportFear3=What, do you think, I want to die? Find another helper.
            TransportFear4=Well, no, I won’t get into such an adventure, you’ll deal with him somehow yourself.
            TransportHaveBusiness=Time is money! This truth does not age with years. I need to mind my own business, if I get involved in all the showdowns along the way, I will quickly go bankrupt.
            TransportHaveBusiness1=I now have enough of my own affairs, turn to someone else.
            TransportHaveBusiness2=Sorry, comrade, but I'm not up to fighting now. Come back another time, okay?
            TransportHaveBusiness3=I have no reason to fight now, come on a little later, okay?
            TransportHaveBusiness4=Buddy, it just so happens that I'm very busy right now, check back later.

            TransportItsYourTranc=Listen, are you a moron or what? If you want to do such things, then lock yourself up in your hangar first, and don’t you dare show such a shame in public!
            TransportOk=Great idea bro! Let's hit him right!
            TransportOk1=And really, why don't I shake things up? There is life in the old dog yet!
            TransportOk2=Well, it's high time to kill this adversary. Computer, full combat readiness!
            TransportOk3=I think it really won’t hurt me to warm up, otherwise I’ve become a transport rat. Now I'll drink "Makhpella Light" for courage and go!
            TransportOk4=I just didn’t have enough money for a bottle of tokilla, and here is such a profitable offer! I'm in!
            TransportSend=Son, I want to ask you for one favor. Do you see <Target>? I need help fighting him.
            TransportSend1=Listen, comrade, here <Target> calls me very bad words, can you help me teach him politeness?
            TransportSend2=This bastard <Target> screwed me away! Let's teach the bad guy a lesson, shall we?
            TransportSend3=A bastard named <Target> wants to take my belongings! Help me in the fight against him, we will share the profit equally.
            TransportSend4=Listen, friend, help me to kill <Target>, I won't forget!
            TransportSuspect=Come on, you, otherwise you’ll knock off a piece of skin of my ship while I fight with him.
            TransportSuspect1=Who are you to waste my time on your business?! Get out of here with your suggestions!
            TransportSuspect2=You are a muddy type, I'm not ready to turn my back on you.
            TransportSuspect3=I don't trust you, let's do it yourself.
            TransportSuspect4=Necessarily! But first, give me at least three reasons why I should trust you.
            TransportWeFriends=The captain of that ship is, by the way, my business partner, and I'm not going to attack him.
            TransportWeFriends1=That is my friend! If you run into him, I'll break off your claws.
            TransportWeFriends2=Yes, we have known each other for a thousand years, what are you talking about! In a decent society, you can get a blow in the face for this.
            TransportWeFriends3=This is my old comrade, I won't shoot him.
            TransportWeFriends4=We don't shoot at our allies, comrade.
            TransportWeFriendsTranc=I don't want to meddle in other humanoids' business for no reason. What if the owner of this tranclucator is a crime boss?
            TransportWeFriendsTranc1=Well, a robot, well, it flies - what harm is it to you? All in all, I'm going to stay away from all of this.
            TransportWeFriendsTranc2=Sorry, <Player>, I'm late with the express delivery. It would be nice to suggest someone to attack for the cause, but I personally have nothing against other humanoids' robots.

            TransportOk1=So be it, you convinced me. I'm dropping the load.
            TransportOk2=Goods, of course, a valuable thing, but life still comes out more expensive. Grab presents.
            TransportOk3=Okay, okay, I don't need problems, comrade, take the cargo and fly to the left, and I'll fly to the right, okay?
            TransportOk4=Your guns will be more powerful than mine, so take them. Fuck knows, why the hell do you need this cargo, but I don’t get into other people’s business, if you want goods, then there is a reason.

If suddenly you didn't got it, which I won’t be surprised at, then this is sarcasm.
            TransportLongDistance1=Where do you get these from? Do you want my money? You can't even catch up with me!
            TransportLongDistance2=And you're funny! Next time threaten me twenty parsecs away.
            TransportLongDistance3=I don’t understand, are you laughing at me or do you really have such long-range guns?
            TransportLongDistance4=Do you really think I'm such an idiot that you think I'll pay you, being a cloud of miles away from you? Oh naive...
            TransportLongDistance5=Eh, in my youth, pirates were completely different - self-esteem did not allow them to demand money from the viewing radius of a modern radar...
            TransportLongDistance6=How daring you are! Send me your photo, as soon as I land on the nearest planet, I will definitely sell it to journalists. Just imagine: the report "Moron of the Year"! So I see: "he robs ships from gigantic distances!" Hey, what's wrong with you? Come on, buddy, this is a joke.
            TransportNo=I will not part with my earned money without a proper reason. Or are you saying that your wreck might be a danger to me?
            TransportNo1=You would fly, you half-educated robber! Now I will inform my sidekick, so he will correct your nozzles!
            TransportNo2=Brother, you have confused something: I'm not an ATM for you, so move your engine somewhere to gobsaurus' den, huh?
            TransportNo3=My money honestly earned over the years of drug trafficking and sales of large batches of weapons, and I do not intend to give it away.
            TransportNo4=Are you completely out of your mind to threaten crime bosses?! Wouldn't you go far and for a long time, would you?
            TransportNo5=Man, I'm in a good mood today, so I'll take this as a failed joke. But you better not make me angry, otherwise you can lose a couple of teeth...
            TransportNo6=Let's see how much money I have here... fifty cr. for a gas station, ten cr. for a tip for a taxi driver, five thousand cr. for the cartel's common fund... I think repairs after the fight will be cheaper than throwing away my money to brats like you, ha ha.
            TransportNo7=Well, why is everyone trying to steal money from our cartel? All such half-wits that they do not understand, since we are the richest, then we are also the best armed? Put your attacks back in the box, you won't get any money from me anyway.
            TransportOk=Your requests for me - a mere trifle. It's easier to pay off and not bother. But in the future I'd rather buy a cruiser.
            TransportOk1=So I saved them, saved up, robbed, traded smuggling, didn’t sleep at night, ate badly! And here you are! Well, you're not ashamed, are you? Okay, I'll transfer...
            TransportOk2=So be it, I'll pay. Accept money order.
            TransportOk3=ow, of course, I have nothing to do, and I will have to pay off, but believe me: as soon as I gain strength, I will immediately find you and kick your ass!
            TransportOk4=Cabbage is always good, but life is better. Take some money.
            TransportOk5=You'll rob me to the bone... Keep your blood money.
            TransportOk6=Listen, maybe a smaller amount will suit you, huh? .. Yes, okay, okay, I'm transferring...
            TransportSumIsVeryBig=For starters, I advise you not to be impudent. If I do not restrain myself, then, you see, your ship will nevertheless fly apart ahead of time with you.
            TransportSumIsVeryBig1=Wait a minute, let me borrow money from my comrade, and you will arrive in a week or two, huh?
            TransportSumIsVeryBig2=Buddy, please don't hit me! Well, I don't have that amount!
            TransportSumIsVeryBig3=The amount that you just mentioned, I lost last week in an elite casino. Reduce amount out of respect for gamers.
            TransportSumIsVeryBig4=Oh, you flattered me... If I had that amount of money, I would, perhaps, not hang out in cold space, but would now be resting somewhere on Mauna Roa...

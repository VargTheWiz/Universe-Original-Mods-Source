        0=Greetings, <Player>!<br>We can fix your ship at a <clr>85% discount<clrEnd> or organize a pirate raid on the system you're interested in. Or maybe you're interested in unique equipment in our store?<br>Either way, make yourself at home.
        1=I'm sorry, but one strike team has already been dispatched, and there's no way to hire a new one.
        2=Unfortunately, there are no pilots available right now in <clr>Dicea<clrEnd>. Check back later.
        21=As you know, <Player>, pirates often appear as an uncontrollable herd, rushing to the call of prey. It's a pity that our guys are often cowards in battles against dominators.<br>But you, as a pirate baron, can direct the pirates' herds in the direction you want. As a rule, the bandits gathered in the secret sector are idle, entertaining themselves by shooting down asteroids and waiting for work. They are the best candidates for attack.<br>The pirates who are allowed into the innermost of the hallows are not nearly as cowardly as the common knuckleheads, and are better at obeying the orders you can give during a battle. Due to the power of the engines, our guys can't fly more than <0> parsecs. Also, you can't send more than one squad at a time.<br>There are currently <1> free thugs hanging out in the <clr>Dicea<clrEnd>. The current cost of hiring one fighter is <2> cr.<br>So, <Player>, are you going to hire those pirates?<br>
        4=At the moment, we control all the nearest systems within a radius of 50 pc.
        54=Baron, the system <0> is already under our control, the pirates, of course, love to shoot at each other, but it may still be worth sending them to fight the enemies of the Brotherhood.
        55=<0> is too far away from <clr>Tortugatz<clrEnd>, not all our guys have hyperdrives that powerful.
        56=There is already a battle going on in the <0> system, it is not too rational to send our guys there.
        8=Well, no way. Ask me if you want to organize another raid.
        9=So, let's check the order:<br>Target system - <0><br>Number of pirates - <1><br>Cost of hiring - <2> cr.<br>So, shall we send the bros into the system <3>?<br>
        23=Your orders have been sent to the pirates. <0> thugs will assemble on <clr>Rogeria<clrEnd> from where they will then proceed to the star <1>. I hope you won't be left out as a sponsor of this fun action.
        44=Where are we going? To <clr>Rogeria<clrEnd>? That's where I'm headed.
        45=Proceeding to <clr>Rogeria<clrEnd> for further instructions.
        29=There's no time for gossip, I have orders from the Baron himself! Oh, it's you... I'm flying to the assembly point, as ordered.
        30=Heading to my place in <clr>Rogeria</clrEnd>. I need to fix the ship before I go to battle.
        31=Getting ready to jump into the system <0>.
        32=We're finally going to battle, and we're sick of chasing asteroids!
        33=My fists are so itchy! I can't wait to shoot someone!
        34=I'm heading for the <0> system. There we'll get a good workout!
        35=Go ahead, boss, I'm all yours.
        36=And who, in fact, should be attacked?
        46=Roger that, boss. Retreating to <clr>Tortugatz<clrEnd>.
        38=Whatever you say, boss. I'll tell the others to concentrate on higher priority goals.
        39=Roger that, boss, attacking the ship <0>.
        47=Retreating to <clr>Tortugatz<clrEnd>.
        52=Copy that, boss. I'm going back to the fight.
        57=Baron, have mercy, what can my destroyed ship do in a battle?
        58=My ship is falling apart on the move, please don't send me back into battle.
        59=A couple more hits and I'm dead, let me step back and patch the holes in the hull.
        60=My ship is in critical condition, I will not even have time to shoot back, allow me to retreat, I am much more useful alive!
        62=Let's see...<br>...<br>Your ship, <Player>, is in excellent condition. It requires no repairs.
        63=Let's estimate the cost of repair...<br>...<br>Well, well... Our cost will be <0> cr. But given your status in the pirate hierarchy, we'll give you a <1>% discount. The total repair price will be <2> cr. How's that sound?
        64=Oh, I almost forgot. You have a Dominator weapon installed on your ship. And as you probably already know, you need nodes to fix it. Let's say, <0> nodes are enough for us.
        65=Whatever you say, <Player>. Really, I'd advise you to get it repaired at such a ridiculous price, but that's your choice.
        66=Great, your money's been withdrawn from the account. Our technicians have already finished their work. Go to the ship, <Player>, and take a look.
        11=I want to organize a pirate raid
        12=I need to fix the ship
        13=I see
        20=Yes
        18=How many pirates do you want to hire?
        14=Cancel the attack
        15=Yes, let's go!
        16=Don't doubt it
        40=We need to attack the ship
        41=Cancel
        42=Retreat from the battle
        43=And pass this order on to all the others
        49=Go back to the battle
        53=Pass this order on to the other retreatants
        61=I guess you're right
        67=Anything else?
        68=Thanks, but I changed my mind
        69=Yes, I agree to pay
        70=I agree to pay <0> cr. for repairs that do not require nodes.
        71=Back

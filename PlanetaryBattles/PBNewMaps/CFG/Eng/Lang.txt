        GovTextLoss=That was bad, ranger, very bad! It seems we cannot task you with missions of importance. Come back in a year and give it another go, if you want.
        GovTextLoss=However, you were insured for the possibility of defeat, which means you'll be paid a sum of <Money> cr. Not bad for your first failure, eh, <Player>?
        GovTextStart=And now it's time to practice. You have many battles ahead of you, but before you can take on serious missions you must first learn the basics of robot war tactics.
        GovTextStart=The first thing you need to learn that the best way to fight machines is with other machines. Our job in this equation is simple: controlling them. We will now give you a robot production facility. These machines are strong, but utterly without intellect. Our engineers have developed three basic programs for them: attack, capture and defend. Putting the robot into one of these three modes nets you an autonomous unit!
        GovTextStart=Of course, you don't actually have to use them. If you are a good strategist, you will be able to command your robots personally. Your objective is to force your way through the obstacles, destroy the enemy combat models and raze their base to the ground. We wish you luck. Remember that you're not actually in any danger. It's just training, <Player>, so be brave!
        GovTextWin=Congratulations, <Player>! You've handled your first mission successfully.
        GovTextWin=We will inform the ranger center that you have completed your training, so that they can start recommending you as an experienced fighter. Your account is also credited with <Money> cr for completing the mission.

        RobotsStart=I will be your instructor. I will teach you how to wage combat on the ground.
        RobotsStart=You are given a one robot production facility, which you can use to build a small robot army. The color of your robots is yellow. Enemy robots may be red, green or blue, reflecting the main colors of the dominator series.
        RobotsStart=There are training targets installed in front of your base. Before moving into action, take control of one of your robots to learn its movements and combat abilities.
        RobotsStart=Then move out and capture a couple of factories that yield resources for the enemy. This is not going to be easy! The robot models are designed for combat and will pose resistance. Eventually you will see the main enemy base. Once you crush their resistance, order your robots to capture it.
        RobotsStart=Now go, <Player>! And if you find yourself in a pickle, call for reinforcements and our helicopters will deliver our best robots to your aid!
        RobotsWin=Well, the robots are history. Good job, <Player>!

        GovTextLoss=Work of seven reconnaissance groups and hundreds of industry spies are under the PACKRYACK! Ranger <Player> - you're an idiot! It's not enough to shoot you - first we'll require you to listen gaals' lections! Okay, at least someone is happy about your incompetence: the Battery Manufacturers and Importers Association gave you a <Money> cr. By the way, if you had won, the award from the government would have been much larger.
        GovTextStart=Wait a minute, please, I'll just change battery. You see, we don't have any sources of energy, and we use the imported batteries.
        GovTextStart=But now everything will change - our genius scientists've stol... I wanted to say, invented revolutionary technology of super-cold nuclear fusion, and even have already built first reactor. But just right after finishing the preparations to start reactor's work, <color=0,50,200>kelleroids</color>, landed on island with reactor, attracted by a powerful energy source. Just imagine this - they're using reactor and steal our energy now! What's the world coming to -<color=0,50,200>dominators</color> robs pelengs... We won't allow them continue such an outrage!
        GovTextStart=If you'll agree to defeat <color=0,50,200>dominators</color>, we'll transport you on a luxury resort island, where the experiment takes place, and give you a first-class robot factory. Make up your mind! If you'll complete this mission, we'll give you some money.
        GovTextWin=Perfectly executed task, <Player>! You'll achieve <Money> cr. for for delivering secret cargos. Peleng's society won't  forget you...
        GovTextWin=What? Which power plant? Remember, we haven't ever built an energy plant. Officially that island doesn't even exis-st. If you even once, even mention about it... DZUHALLAG hear all... You've just transported a secret cargo from point A to point B. Standard government task...

        RobotsStart=The <color=255,240,100>terronoids</color> landed right before you, so the battle won't be easy. From government funds we give you a lot of batteries - as it says, what are we rich in...
        RobotsStart=Good luck, and don't catch cold!

        GovTextLoss=Ranger <Player>, you have not fulfilled your contract. How come, we thought you were an honest humanoid, and you're cheating on us. I'm afraid you'll be with us for a long time - the court is already considering our claim against you for material damages. Wait a minute, let me take a look... Damn clerks! Couldn't they have written it in smaller print?! All right, we'll pay you a portion of your due, in the amount of <Money> cr, for having fought nominally according to your contract after all.
        GovTextStart=<Player> If you've heard of the famous resorts on the island of Mauna Roa, you know that it's the most expensive and most luxurious resort in the entire galaxy, and only the wealthiest people can afford to rest here. A huge mountain in the middle of the ocean, with skiing at the top and lounging on beaches at the bottom.
        GovTextStart=And, of course, such a resort brings a lot of money, or rather brought: recently on the island of Mauna Roa have landed <color=0,50,200>dominators</color>, and all the vacationers had to be evacuated. What the machines want there is unknown, but we suffer terrible losses from their invasion. You, <Player>, must understand the depth of our problem, we ask you to help us in clearing the island - for a solid fee, of course.
        GovTextWin=It was a masterful job, <Player>, if all the merchants will fight as well, we will not be afraid of any <color=0,50,200>dominators</color>. By the way, we found out that <color=0,50,200>terronoids</color> mined from the ground - it was silver ore, which they wanted to use for the electronic stuff of ships. And now it will cover all our expenses and losses, and even paying you <Money> cr. will not affect our income at all. By the way, please get the money and sign right here.

        RobotsLoss=It's a total collapse! Even worse than the stock market the year before last. Ranger <Player>, you really let us down. Now the military will take over the island - and after them there will be radiation, craters, chemical weapons, and all that kind of crap... Goodbye, vacation on a fancy island.
        RobotsStart=As you can see, the situation is complicated:
        RobotsStart=The <color=255,240,100>terronoids</color>, who landed first, burrowed deep into the mountain, hiding from the bomber pilots we hired, and dug a path right into the landing pad, destroying our air force. After that, they bred some mechanical bugs all over the island, knocked out the navigation systems of guided missiles, and began to actively mine some rock from under the mountain. Just before you got to the island, the <color=255,240,100>blazeroids</color> landed, pressed <color=255,240,100>terronoids</color> down on the coast and knocked them out of the mountain.
        RobotsStart=You have an excellent base, several factories, and a large supply of resources - we are not in the habit of economizing on vital things.
        RobotsWin=Excellent! Now we have the island under our control. We're urgently sending construction teams to rebuild infrastructure and build new recreation bases. And you, <Player>, are already expected with the report in the government, however, until the evening you can still rest on the beaches of the battlefield.

        GovTextLoss=I just knew I shouldn't have trusted a ranger with this job. Your inept command led to a planetary disaster of epic proportions, and now it's me they will hold responsible for it. Besides, not only am I the fall guy now as the person in charge of this mess, but I also have to pay you <Money> cr -- the "danger money." Yeah, danger my butt! By the way, had you accomplished your mission, the payout would have been much larger, and our planet wouldn't have been on the brink of an environmental disaster.
        GovTextStart=Would you like some coffee, <Player>?
        GovTextStart=No? Well, fine, we ourselves don't want that crap: you see, we have serious problems with drinkable water, or rather with the lack of it. Many years ago our planet was extremely rich in minerals, but alas - we treated the resources too wastefully and soon were left without them. Our scientists have come up with a very interesting program - recycling and using garbage! It sounds incredible, doesn't it? Nevertheless, we managed to build recycling plants in the <color=0,50,200>Trash</color> valley, our planet's most grandiose waste dump, and even got very optimistic results.
        GovTextStart=Alas - our factories and such an abundance of resources, gathered in one place, have attracted the attention of <color=0,50,200>dominators</color>. A huge army of battle-torn <color=0,50,200>blazeroids</color>, <color=0,50,200>terronoids</color> and <color=0,50,200>kelleroids</color> landed in the valley. They've taken over our factories, refurbished them and are using them for self-repair. They got rid of all the sewage treatment and pollution control facilities! In just a couple of weeks <color=0,50,200>dominators</color> have created the most real ecological disaster on our planet - the water is poisoned, the ozone layer around the planet is melting, and animals are dying out in whole species!
        GovTextStart=Please - help us get rid of <color=0,50,200>dominators</color>! Health... even the life of the entire planet is at stake! We'll help you in any way we can, and we'll pay you great money for your work!
        GovTextWin=Bravo, <Player>, bravo! Now our planet is not only saved from ecological disaster, but also provided with resources for many decades - <color=0,50,200>dominators'</color> plants are perfectly repurposed for industrial mining of recyclables, and the wreckage of robots themselves can be recycled... But we haven't forgotten you - judging by your greenish face, you're either a peleng, or your health was seriously damaged on the island <color=0,50,200>Trash</color>, and for the treatment we allocate you <Money> cr. Rest, you deserve it. Oh, and let me shake your hand goodbye - what you did for us will never be forgotten!

        RobotsLoss=This is a real disaster!!! Toxic waste is about to float out of the valley, and then the contamination of the planet will be impossible to stop! Get out of here, you'll only get in the way of evacuating the population from the dangerous areas.
        RobotsStart=Greetings, ranger. I think you've already figured out what's going on here by yourself. Toxic waste and fumes have already entered the water - it has become undrinkable, and all aquatic life is dying out in mass. We recommend that you do not approach the water closer than... In general we recommend not to approach - and even better you do not go out of the suit at all. Look - even the air here is poisonous fumes, and if you won't destroy <color=255,240,100>dominators</color>, this fate soon awaits the entire planet! Hurry up!
        RobotsWin=Fine! Our environmental engineers are already working on removing the contamination, and the technologists are examining the plants which have been modified by the Dominators. You, <Player>, go to the government building immediately, our famous politicians want to thank you personally. They hope to make you even more famous by shaking your heroic hand in front of numerous stereo cameras. Just remember, I didn't tell you that.

        GovTextLoss=Alas, this is our fault... We bet too much on you, and we didn't even provide the resources and support you needed. It is not for nothing that the great Tzort-Haanotzri said, "Haste is the road to defeat," but we, not remembering his instructions, did not take enough time to prepare in advance... Well, and, of course, you won't be left without a reward in <Money> cr. Yes, it is, alas, not as high as you deserve, for the station has never been liberated, and we will have to buy the services of mercenaries to clean it up.
        GovTextStart=Well, <Player>, we have just the job. There is a station on our planet for the disposal of military equipment, and this station once worked for an entire sector - what can I say, even the Maloqs trust us with such a task, always afraid that their obsolete equipment will be used against them.
        GovTextStart=Of course, when the Dominators took over our planet, the first thing they did was to get their manipulators on the station and all the equipment it contained. Fortunately, the only weapons in storage at the time were Maloq armored personnel carriers and human "Kasatka" helicopters, both of which were of outdated design and extremely worn out. When the planet was liberated, we were horrified to discover that the station and warehouses had been almost completely dismantled by the Dominators, and were used as building materials and resources for the production of modular robots. The station plays a key role in the project of disarmament and peaceful resolution of conflicts between the races of the Coalition, and we hope that you will undertake to clear it of dominators, for the sake of the preservation of the commonwealth of the five races.
        GovTextWin=Please take this pill, <Player>. Great, now take a drink. This is anti-radine - we are saving the health of the heroes of this war. Well, and, of course, your contribution to the fight not only with thinking machines, but also with interspecies discord will be rewarded: <Money> cr. - mere dust compared to the good you have done, but we know how much you Rangers need the money.

The only problem that can get in your way is the lack of electronics. Alas, the scrap that is used to build everything here and that feeds the dominator factories is extremely poor in this material, so try to economize.
        RobotsWin=Victory! Of course, we shouldn't rejoice over the sin of Destruction, but there was much more at stake - peace and friendship between the races of the Coalition. But you are tired after the battle, and probably irradiated - after all, we got the maloq APCs from the nuclear conflict on the Drubagryz satellite - so quickly get into the landing helicopter, and return to the capital comfort.

Use them wisely, take your time and think every step of the way. What's the saying? Oh, yes: "In haste you mock the people and piss off the maloqs. We've flooded the area around the stadium with a special substance, I think the humans call it trinitrotoluene, so that the Dominators are blocked from taking over the entire planet. They've already destroyed the bridge on the track, so hurry up and don't let them ruin the rest of the equipment and structures! The enemy has already spotted us, so expect visitors from the east.

It's just a bunch of enemy's robots and a huge pile of resources. Of course, you're not quite a lost humanoid yet, so we'll give you <Money> cr for your stupid persistence. Spend it wisely, that is, on booze, women, and casinos.
        GovTextStart=There is such a thing - a shipment of drugs from Colombia. It is such a famous place on Earth in certain communities. You should know how valuable a shipment of 300 tons of natural marijuana can be in this age of synthetic drugs. Now, that shipment disappeared into, uh... neutral waters at the beginning of the war, when the Dominators occupied our planet, and now that our world has been liberated, some experts have managed to track down the containers rather roughly. Alas, there are still Dominators on the island where they landed. As you understand, we cannot use weapons of mass destruction - who knows where exactly these containers are lost, and whether they will be hit by bombs or the shockwave of an orbital gun, and in fact the Great Lyakusha and a third of Dzuhallag's top brass have a stake.
        GovTextStart=Well, you see where I'm going with this? Yes, it smells like a lot of money, if you know how to handle combat robots. Do not worry, we do not cheat you - 5% of the bounty, and it's about <color=0,50,200>50 000 000</color> cr, you interested? Yes, I see that you are friendly humanoid. Deal?
        GovTextWin=You know what, ranger? I was looking at the contract while you were flying, and here on page 357, yes - yes, the fine print... Take a magnifying glass... Aha! See? It's a " linking" of royalties for planetary strategic missions to the current inflation index. Alas, accountancy is powerless here...

        RobotsStart=There you are! As you can see, the robot has handled itself, cleared the approach and got close to the dominators, you act next! One more thing!!! First - intelligence reports that there is at least one Coalition robot on the island, captured by the terronoids, most likely for some kind of research experiments. Perhaps this robot will be able to help you somehow, but first you need to get to him. Second, carefully study your robot's radar - this information will make this operation easier.
        RobotsWin=You did it, the island is cleared! Another bathyscaphe is coming for you, and this one ran out of fuel. Well, we didn't get our hopes up for a "positive result" and saved some money. But now we can not save money and even build a huge monument to you, or maybe a hologram.

        GovTextLoss=<Player>, there is no time to investigate - there is a general evacuation of the entire population of the island. Ah, yes, ranger, you are entitled to a small compensation - <Money> cr. You'll be able to buy a nice sleeping bag and cot with this money.
        GovTextStart=Hello, Ranger! We want to give you a task - to guard an island. Not just any island, but a world-class resort. White sandy beaches, coconut palms, swarthy human savages in only loincloths... I'm sorry, no savages, but it's paradise without them, and you just have to spend a couple of days there, looking after combat robots, while sipping cocktails from fancy glasses... You know, with those little umbrellas and a slice of faruk on the rim...
        GovTextStart=More than that, we'll pay you for it! Honestly, I cut myself without a knife! Yes, I would go myself if I were qualified to drive robots.
        GovTextWin=<Player>, great win! We knew we could rely on you. We finally managed to figure out why the elite landing troops were rushing to this island. The fact is that archaeologists dug up the tanks of the "BARSHIL KLYN" series, which used graphite self-propelled projectiles, which were later banned under an intergalactic agreement. These forbidden projectiles interested the Dominators. It's a good thing you kept them out of these deadly advances. Your well-deserved reward of <Money> cr. transferred to ypur account.

        RobotsStart=<Player>, good to see you, buddy! Relax, there's nobody on this godforsaken island, except archaeologists, who dig in the ground and dig up XXV century military equipment instead of dinosaurs. Although there's one Tarantula-series Kelleroid landing bot lurking in orbit, it doesn't pose much of a threat since you have three combat bases and all of the island's industry under your command. Oh yes, the archaeologists reported that they noticed some shifting of the soil in the south and west, but that's okay - it often happens in mountainous terrain. So, get to work. I hope you won't be disturbed, and that you'll have a good rest on this beautiful island.
        RobotsWin=<Player>, on behalf of the archaeologists I offer you thanks for not letting the Dominators take over this unique island. We will open here a museum of military glory on the little-known war with the inhabitants of the black holes. Here you can find their remains and study this obscure race.

        GovTextLoss=And you have been allocated <Money> cr. - With this money you can buy a booklet with the dragon.
        GovTextStart=<Player>, do you love nature? There is a very delicate mission for you - to save just eggs. Don't laugh, it's not just any, it's a dragon eggs. The thing is, the Dominators have figured out how to recycle those damn eggs and use them in production. All weapons that use dragon egg stuff have a destructive power. The dragon itself can't defend its nest because the dominators have used long-acting stun guns, making the dragon stand rock-like, silent, and immersed in eternity, so go at once.
        GovTextWin=<Player> What a great victory! We knew we could count on you. Now a sanctuary will be established on the island. I'll tell you a secret that now we ourselves will use this dominator development and make this dragon eggs stuff, but the dragon population will be preserved, well of course <Money> cr, your fee - it has already been transferred to your account.

I already transferred the money to your account, so hurry up!
        GovTextStart=Well, <Player>, how do you feel about endangered species? What? You're saying you don't feel about endangered species at all? Well, yes, of course, but there are more defenseless creatures in the galaxy than intelligent humanoids... Like, say, giant subterranean worms. Yes, you heard right - due to the shrinking areas of sand deserts and red thickets, saline oases that are the natural habitat of these wondrous beas... creatures, they have almost disappeared from the face of the our planet, and remain only on the arid island of Arahis. But even this was not enough - after another attack of the Dominators on our system, we found their troop on this island. Of course, they are probably not happy that they have chosen such shaky ground for their purposes, but in the final result in the confrontation with the worms technology will win, and we can not allow that, especially since the local natives, the desert tribe of gordons, consider these worms sacred someone, i don't know exactly, and will take mortal offense at us in case of their disappearance. Given that they outnumber us ten to one, they would be well within their power to take revenge on the offenders.
        GovTextStart=I think you've guessed by now that it's up to you to protect the worms, and by extension our throats and skulls, from the knives and crowbars of gordons. And believe us, the reward will be worth it.
        GovTextWin=Let me shake your hand! Let me kiss you! Don't you want to? Well, I'll do with words - your efforts have saved the worm population, and, as you understand, the well-being of our planet! By the way, are you aware that during the dismantling of the dominator ship we found in its hold worm larvae, previously unknown to science? Soon we will be able to clone them, and restore the population of worms in the deserts - the gordons will be glad when they start to be devoured by their own pets...

        RobotsStart=You're just in time, <Player> - the Dominators have just launched strange generators that paralyze the worms. They'll last at most twenty-four hours without movement, and then, hello, Gordon-style Jihad. So hurry up, ranger, you're the one to be hoped for.
        RobotsWin=Finally! Our biotechnologists have already flown out to bring the worms back to life. I recommend you to go back as well, as you will hardly enjoy being near a very angry, very hungry and very big worm...

        GovTextLoss=Not only did we lose such a valuable network of underground bunkers, the defense complex of the island, and several square kilometers of the shelf around, but after the bombing it started to go all over the capital, where glass flew from shock waves. What a waste! Although, of course, it's worth noting your courage - even when it was clear that defeat was imminent, you continued to command the robots, delaying the time for our response so that deserved at least - some reward... Take, <Money> cr.
        GovTextStart=Oh, <Player>, come in, come in, we have a mission for you. There is a small island near our capital, which, as you may have already realized, has been taken over by the Dominators. A quick decision is required of you, or the government will be in trouble. Since our system was recently liberated from the Dominators, you can still find these creatures on its planets, and radars have spotted them on an island with many strategic bases and factories that has been prepared to fend off attacks. We certainly don't want all the facilities to go to the dominators, much less fear for our government. Don't worry, <Player>, we'll pay you, or other volunteers, a decent reward for repelling the threat of the Dominators! So, will you take it?
        GovTextWin=Ranger <Player>? Here are your <Money> cr. - Please bother to sign for receipt. Are you still here? We already have a lot of problems with this island - because there was a bunker for VIPs in case of invasion, and the Dominators have welded it up... There's so much to build in such a short time. Well, ranger, you're not a builder - you can't help us, but if your services are needed - you'll be the first candidate for the job.

Don't be so afraid, an evacuation team will take you now.
        RobotsStart=You have a night operation ahead of you. We managed to take back one of our bases, now it's up to you! Since this military-strategic island has a shield that extinguishes all radar readings, perhaps the dominators have no idea that you have already arrived. The situation is as follows: the Kelleroids and Blazeroids have taken over very important hubs and have started a war between themselves for the right to control all of the island's resources. Your task is to confront and defeat them. Begin.

        GovTextLoss=Well, at least you held on until the end and... Wait, let me scan you... Yes, yes, you didn't steal the priceless dia... Uh... uh... Minerals. According to the standard strategist's contract, you are entitled to a portion of the <Money> cr. reward. But this is far less than the reward you would have received for a successful operation.
        GovTextStart=Yes, an assignment just for a desperate guy like you, <Player>. Are you familiar with such a rock as kimberlite? I can tell by your eyes that you are not. Well, I'll have to explain: it's a semi-precious decorative mineral, sky-blue in color. It is rather highly valued as a decorative material and material for statues, especially among the people and the Gaalians, but of a particular value are the almost always accompanying minerals of dia... More valuable minerals.
        GovTextStart=Just recently we discovered that one of the volcanic islands in the ocean is almost entirely composed of kimberlite, which means it is a serious source of... valuable minerals. Our geologists have even dug a pipe of blue kimberlite and organized the extraction of minerals and kimberlite itself in a well-equipped quarry. But alas, the source of valuable minerals quickly drew the attention of the Dominators, and during one of their attacks, they landed their bases on the island. During the defense of the quarry, our troops were only able to recapture one of the dominator bases, and hold it for some time, but among them there are no experienced strategists, which, according to the network of ranger centers, you are.
        GovTextStart=The choice is yours - if you agree, we guarantee a solid reward.
        GovTextWin=Oh! Here you are, <Player>. We didn't expect to wait for your arrival. By the way, stand still for a moment, I'm going to scan you now... Strange... I'm going to X-ray you again...

        GovTextLoss=Don't be surprised, <Player>, the Complex was very important to us, and we couldn't risk it, so we invited a group of human special forces, trained specifically to fight the dominator ground forces in hand-to-hand combat, as a backup plan. While you were flying, they had already managed to take out all of the machines' production facilities, and began to successfully destroy the modular robots. Of course, their services are not cheap, so your fee had to be cut by at least a thousand times, and it is now <Money> cr.
        GovTextStart=Of course, you are very welcome. As an upstanding member of the truly intelligent races, and as a ranger trained in strategic combat, you have the opportunity to participate in the liberation of an important part of our planet, namely the Complex. It is a system of mining, processing and assembly automated industries, fully autonomous yet highly productive-the pinnacle of Faeyan thought in the field of ACS. When the Dominators were pushed off our planet, they encamped there, judiciously appreciating the tremendous value of the facility. However, we had foreseen such a move, and even before the surrender of the planet installed in a strategically important node of the Complex all the necessary equipment for a secret operation, with a competent command giving a 72.537% chance of success. And what a useful coincidence that at the onset of urgent need we had the owner of that very competent command in your person, whom we propose to lead the liberation operation.
        GovTextWin=Thanks to your competent command and intelligent approach to planning, the Complex was returned to its rightful owners. That's the power of intelligence! And, of course, you will not be left without reward: <Money> cr., and we will certainly be sure to invite you to a suitable mission, when new threats arise.

As the analytics department say, if you organize your defense with the resources you have allotted, you can deplete, and then throw back the dominators. Of course, you have the right to change tactics, but at your own risk.

Well, and we mustn't forget about you - you see, you weren't on this island. Yes, yes, you weren't there. We simply had no right to send an employee of the coalition government, who, due to the confusion in the law, you are, to the quarantine zone. We will even pay you a <Money> cr. for your silence.

        GovTextStart=The point is that the Dominators have landed in our planet's quarantine zone - a kind of a dumping ground for toxic and radioactive waste, accumulated over centuries of industry development on our planet. I don't know how they manage to survive there, if even our best repair robots were dissolved in the local ponds, or melted in the streams of gas rushing out of the ground. Nevertheless, the Dominators are apparently not particularly bothered by the hostile environment - they have even staged a small local war between them for control of the island. We don't mind them taking each other apart, but sooner or later one of them will win, and, as you understand, that's not going to do any good. You can, of course, bomb the hell out of the island, but there's a chance that you'll blow up all the crap that's been piled up there for years to atmosphere. In short, as you understand, we would like to solve this problem by means of a ground operation, and we suggest that you lead it. If successful, you will be paid a very, very handsome fee.

        GovTextLoss=A, <Player>! Greetings, Vorotilov in person. Minister Garin is fired, the court case about the Evolution project is about to begin. There was a lot of money allocated to it and - poof! Soap bubble. I've already looked into your case, you know, you've done a "pretty good job". You managed to do your part, so to speak. You could have saved the case, but you blew it. But there's no time to judge you, it's not that smooth, and I'm sure your lawyer will get you out of it somehow. But my advice to you is to get off this planet before it's too late. You might as well get brainwashed as an accomplice. Thank you for your time. Oh, I almost forgot... You've been paid a refund into your account. Bureaucrats, what can I say... Compensation is what you're supposed to pay for a botched operation.
        GovTextStart=Yes. It is necessary to destroy the Dominator forces at the top-secret Deep Ocean Underground Complex Evolution. I inform you: Project Evolution was discovered almost immediately after the Dominators invaded the human planets, in 3297. Deep beneath the ocean floor, a scientific complex was built with the goal of creating an ideal combat robot (ICR) that would combine the power of the Blazer combat matrices, Keller's pseudo-intelligence and the subconscious attraction to power of Terron. The head of the project is me personally, the Minister of Defense of the planet <Planet> <color=0,50,200>Hector Garin</color>. The idea of the project: our Galaxy, like a living organism, will develop an antibody based on the aggressors, which will destroy the threat. The project was guarded inside and out, was classified... Until some time. After activation, the ICR prototype got out of control, suppressed the nearest defense systems and activated the donor robots. The combat robots spread out into sectors, captured most of the complex, finished off the complex's remaining defense systems, and fortified themselves. You, <Player>, need to clear the complex of enemy forces. You will receive everything you need: a map of the complex, a bathyscaphe for landing of strike team, a squad of robots on full alert and a small supply of resources, as well as additional instructions on the spot. If you agree, sign here or leave my office. If successful, you will receive an incredible reward from the higher-ups. Perhaps the Commander himself will be here soon... ...but it doesn't matter. If you fail, both you and I will be court-martialed.
        GovTextWin=A, <Player>! Greetings, Vorotilov in person. Minister Garin is fired, the court case about the Evolution project is about to begin. There was a lot of money allocated to it and - poof! Soap bubble. Everything worked out for you in the best possible way. Specialists will get what they need from the comlex, and then we'll blow it up. You have been credited with <Money> cr for your excellent work and assistance in the operation. Not bad, eh? But my advice to you is to get off this planet before it's too late. Otherwise it's not too late to be brainwashed as an accomplice. Thank you for your attention. You're free to go.

        RobotsLoss=<Player>? This is Vorotilov speaking. Go immediately to the government building. With your things and your documents. It doesn't matter who I am, because you'll have to forget my surname. That's an order. You'll find out later. Over and out.
        RobotsStart=All right, I'm giving you an extra briefing. We've uploaded you a map of the complex. There are six sectors in GOPK, listed by increasing priority of importance: emergency sector, transport sector, power generation sector, security sector, main sector, CSS (Closed Science Sector). Only two sectors have access to the surface: the transport sector and the emergency sector. On a special alarm declared in the security sector, these exits were blocked (but for you we managed to get a one-time zero-level access code to the emergency sector), and the way from the main sector to the CSS was completely blocked, closing the ICR there. If you succeed, the specialists will take all the valuable materials from the complex, and then it will be blown up. The paths between the sectors work as usual, there is power, since the dominators have not yet reached the power generation sector, the lights are on everywhere and the systems work normally. Hurry, time is short and the enemy is strong. Right now, the Kelleroids have taken the main sector, the Terronoids took control on the transport sector, and the Blazeroids occupied the security sector. In the emergency complex there is a reserve base for robot production, use it. You might also be short on titanium, since this complex is scientific, not manufacturing. Good luck!
        RobotsWin=<Player>? This is Vorotilov speaking. Go immediately to the government building. With your things and your documents. It doesn't matter who I am, because you'll have to forget my surname. That's an order. You'll find out later. Over and out.

        GovTextLoss=Now we'll have to blow up the missile with another weapon, and after destroying the dominators, blow up the hell out of the military base! This action is immoral, Ranger <Player>, I'm waiting for an explanation!
        GovTextStart=The planet <Planet>, as you, <Player>, probably know, was recently liberated from the Dominators. The liberation cost us a lot of casualties - we were forced to use nuclear weapons. Two nuclear missiles were fired at the dominator bases by the F99-2 missile division of the planet <Planet>. The Dominators, having discovered the division, headed there in order to prevent the launch of a third, not yet launched, missile. The threat of total annihilation hangs over the capital megalopolis - who knows how the Dominators will dispose of the last missile? We have sent a robot landing force, and you, as a valiant warrior, must lead it.
        GovTextWin=Thank you, that was a good lesson for our government, now we will give up nuclear weapons. The military budget has been reduced by <color=0,50,200>10</color><Money> cr. <Money> cr. you get as a reward, and with the rest of the money we'll put up a monument to the ranger <Player>!

The main thing is not to lose this battle, because the Dominators are on the alert, and if they get our rocket at their disposal, the inhabitants of the planet <Planet> should not expect anything good.

        GovTextLoss=Ha! And you still dare to call yourself a warrior after what you've done? Now Ryana - Modin is lost for us for a long time - the elite units of the Red Guard have already begun to sweep the island, and they work so that even hell after their invasion will be a hundred times scarier. Eh, I wish I could put you under three hundred years with life extension, or torture you for five months, but then my colleague reminded me of the strict laws of the ranger centers, and the fines with seven zeros for breaking them, so get your pathetic compensation in <Money> cr., and get out while you're still alive.
        GovTextStart=Task, you say? You're just in time... It's exactly the kind of guy we can trust with this kind of mission, which you wouldn't trust to any merchant or pirate, let alone, ugh, some faey or yellowtail. No, the national sacred place at stake is the island of Ryana-Modin. It's hard to say how important this island is to our planet. If only because there are no such words in the non-Maloqan languages, and the censors would cut it all out later anyway... What was I saying? Yes, Ryana-Modin, a hard, icy island where the young Maloqs have held initiation ceremonies since colonization. Older veterans competed in fishing, and lovers sealed their marriages by hunting ferocious cave-dwelling saber-toothed grakrobahs together... Now, this island was overrun by dominators!
        GovTextStart=We'd love to send all our ground troops there, but they'll tear it to shreds, and then wipe the shreds to dust and swallow the hell out of it. You'll have to act, as they say, by the textbook - with robots, tactics, and such nonsense that all rangers are rubbed in during their training. You don't chicken out, do you?
        GovTextWin=Glory to you, <Player>, savior of Ryana - Modin! For your heroism, courage, and military prowess, as well as your not-so-revered, but still useful intelligence and insight, that saved the shrine from the hands of... Paws... What have they got there...? Ah, ma - ni - pu - la - tors of the dominators. You will be added to the list of heroes of the planet <Planet>. Posthumously... Heh heh, just kidding!
        GovTextWin=Well, heroism is heroism, but you always have to eat, and everyone knows what reward a ranger likes best: money. And exactly <Money> goes to your account.

And, that is, if the island will fuc... ... if you will lose the island, we'll rip your head off, so don't screw it up.

Well, we wanted to give you a day to hunt, but I guess the weather here is worse than the Dominators for you. Don't worry, the helicopters will be here in a few minutes.

        GovTextLoss=You know, Ranger, the fight was televised, and nobody on this planet likes a losers... Oh, how they don't like losers. Although, since you defended to the last robot, instead of running away like a coward, you deserve a small compensation - <Money> cr. Buy yourself a bulletproof vest and a portable dosimeter with this money - I assure you it will come in handy.
        GovTextStart=You know, ranger, before the advent of third-generation protective fields, the army had a type of weapon called barrel artillery. We had it until about the middle of the Klissan War, but it was eventually decommissioned. Now it turns out that we are almost the only planet that hasn't had its guns melted down, and they, are worth a lot of money like rarities and antiques!
        GovTextStart=The only problem is that on the island where we once dumped the decommissioned guns, the Dominators now continue to run the place. Yes, you're a very clever humanoid - we used to execute such people... Just kidding. You guessed right, our homeland needs your help.
        GovTextWin=Hold them, hold them! What? What did they tie him with? With panties? What a situation, <Player> - fans still managed to crush the lines of security, and now rushing here. Hurry up and get your <Money> - a share of the price of the artillery, and get in the hangar.

        RobotsStart=Well, here you have arrived. I will not say a long speech - here is your base, here are the dominators, and now make scrap metal out of them!
        RobotsWin=Ha! You showed them how to fight! Honestly, after the fight was broadcast on stereovision, you're a national hero now. Well, to keep the autograph crowd from crushing you, we'll send a helicopter to take you directly to the government building.

        GovTextLoss=Not enough resources?!  The operation failed because of your mediocre command! Everything has failed! Now the Dominators won't leave us alone, and will occupy our planet completely. Though I must pay tribute to you - you fought to the end and still managed to wipe out the enemy forces - perhaps the whole planet can still be saved. Here, please - a small sum in the form of <Money> cr we pay you for your assistance in the operation. Goodbye, <Player>.
        GovTextStart=We have a task of special importance for you. The problem must be solved as soon as possible, because it can subsequently have a very detrimental effect on the life of our planet. The point is that our industrial center, the Black island, has been encircled and captured by dominators. Our scientists are sure that the place of capture was not chosen by chance, and there is a very simple and logical explanation - the largest oil deposits found on the planet to this day are on the Black island.
        GovTextStart=We unfortunately learned about this very recently: only a year ago the construction of the first oil platform began, and the lack of funds significantly slowed down the development of the subsoil. Since <Planet> was under the dominators, we of course tried to discount the construction - and bring it to completion, as discreetly as possible. Unfortunately, a couple of months ago the invaders exposed us, and the blazeroids completed the platform, built a purification unit in the west of the island, and on the east of the island the terronoids managed to completely destroy the kelleroids. According to expert predictions, we will be able to establish uninterrupted production of components and supply resources for robot production only if we take control of the wells. At the moment, our resource reserves are at a critical level.
        GovTextStart=So, <Player>, do you agree to free the planet <Planet> from hostile robots and help us revive the grand authoritarian oil economy?
        GovTextWin=Thanks to your skillful command, <Player>, the operation is successful! Now the planet <Planet> will be able to get out of the economic crisis, although we still do not have enough vehicles to transport oil. However, this is our problem, and we pay you a cash bonus in the form of <Money> cr. for the success of the operation.

        RobotsStart= Here we are on the Black island. As you can see, the blazeroids are well fortified at their base, but they have one weak spot: the fact is that during the construction of the platform on the island there was dug <color=255,240,100>underground tunnel</color>, through which the pipeline runs. Neither the blazeroids nor the terronoids, as far as we know, are aware of its existence, which is why I suggest you use this "secret passage".
        RobotsStart=Good luck!

        GovTextLoss=<Player>, great, you're back already! So, how's your impression of being in a bunny suit? Ha-ha-ha... I'm kidding, get your contract money - <Money> cr. And come see us again when we realize this transfactorial beacon project on another island.
        GovTextStart=<Player>, you are just in time! There is one urgent task for you: go to the experimental island, take everything of value on our base and leave there as soon as possible - find somewhere more secure. We'll send a flyer to evacuate you, and don't try to prove to us that you'll take back the base at any cost. The fact is that there were plans to create a trap on the island, to destroy the Dominators, and for this purpose a very powerful transfactorial beacon and an elaborate system of defensive-destructive complex was built. But the problem is that, for some reason, the beacon was activated, communication with the island was lost, and we did not have time to build fortified area. Go to the site immediately.
        GovTextWin=<Player>, you are a true ranger. Although you should have been punished for disobeying an order, we are glad that everything ended well, and we are ready to pay a reward - a much larger amount than in the contract - <Money> cr.

        RobotsStart=<Player>, have you been ordered to inform us of an emergency evacuation? Yes, the government is absolutely right. The best kelleroid landing troops have already arrived on the island, and it looks like we really need to get out of here. We won't be able to hold back the attack here, the fortified area is still in the planning stages and only two long-range cannons have been built. The transfactorial beacon went off from reloading due to a blazeroid sabotage. They created a very powerful energy transmitter and apparently figured out our plans with the beacon long ago.
        RobotsWin=<Player>, you did it! You liberated the whole island! But... You violated the evacuation order! Well, as they say, those who win in battle are not to be condemned. They're already waiting for you in the government with a report.

        GovTextLoss=Hmm, <Player>, are you sure you're a ranger? You couldn't defeat some three pathetic bunch of dominators! Show me your identification! Strange, you are really a ranger. In spite of your complete failure, we pay you a sum of <Money> cr for your labors. For it is said, "The ability to forgive is the trait of the true believer!" But we advise you, nevertheless, to leave our planet quickly, so as not to lead us into temptation...
        GovTextStart=Hello, hello, ranger <Player>! Perhaps something alcoholic? For you, as a glorified fighter, at a very reasonable price! Ha-ha-ha! It's a joke, of course, as is the offer of alcohol. As you know, drinking alcoholic drinks is strictly forbidden here! Our church monitors this very closely. By the way, it was at the request of the church that we invited you. The fact is that not every priest here can practice the Sacraments. To do that he must go through various ordinations, but! A real clergyman must have a full beard, a face like the full moon, and a very respectable tummy! Without these attributes, no one will ever believe that he is a real priest. We even have a special island for this purpose, where young men who have graduated from a theological seminary live, gaining the necessary prestige. The name of the island is Heaven Garden. And now about the problem. Not so long ago, the Dominators landed on the island. All three series! I don't know what attracted them there so much, maybe the... uh... our fathers' faces were so glowing, you could see it even from space? Well, it doesn't matter, as long as we lost control of the island. Our holy fathers are angry! You must take this island back before all the clerics lose weight to an inappropriate size. True, you will only have one base at your disposal. It's a good thing Father Sidor was able to lock himself up there in time, really, leaving everyone else to be torn apart by the Dominators... But we still got the base. So, do you want to do this good work? Or should we look for someone more responsible?
        GovTextWin=It was just inimitable! We saw everything with the surveillance cameras. The hand of the Lord stretched over your work, the light streamed from His eyes, and the word of the Lord destroyed the enemy as well as any weapon!  The robots under your leadership crushed the foes without regard for their own damage. Father Sidor marched in the forefront of the army, and his prayers turned your enemies to ashes! We congratulate you on your victory and hope that one day you will turn your face to the Lord and enter our theological seminary. In the meantime, you will receive a modest sum of <Money> cr. By the way, you can donate it for the development of our church, all the necessary papers are ready, all you have to do is to sign here... Wait, where are you going...

        GovTextLoss=Well, what's your problem, ranger <Player>? We had to waste an entire nuclear bomb because of some little underground base! Aren't you ashamed to put our planet into an economic crisis? Ashamed, ashamed, we know. At least you fought to the end and didn't run away like a coward. For your courage, the government decided to give you a sum of <Money> cr. And you could have received much more money if you had shown, apart from your courage, also military cunning, but that's okay, humanoids learn from their mistakes. I think next time you will definitely win!
        GovTextStart=Our planet <Planet> we has a mountain range with loose soils in which it is very convenient to dig tunnels. Why am I saying this? It's just that during the occupation, the Dominators did it! These Terronoids dug a base in the depths of the snow-covered mountains and settled there very well. We wouldn't have noticed anything if a faction of Kelleroids hadn't decided to take over this base. All of this endangers the mining of rare crystals in these mountains, and by the way, the Dominators are up to it, too. Maybe that's why they came to us. Anyway, the base isn't finished yet, which gives us a chance to attack quickly. And another thing: we can provide only a few combat robots for this operation, the rest you will have to get in battle. I think it won't be too hard for such a great strategist. Do you agree, Ranger <Player>?
        GovTextWin=Good job, just great! Now, in addition to the mine, we also have an underground base in which we can take shelter in case of attack. Of course, we can't save the population, but the government is still more valuable! Ah, what prospects, what scale... But there's no point in having a government without the people, I told a little wrong. And why should we hide when there are people like you, Ranger? Here, take a modest reward for your work in the amount of <Money> cr. Take it, take it, you, <Player>, honestly deserve this money!

        RobotsStart=Commander <Player>, let me briefly describe the peculiarities of the upcoming battle. As you can see, the left side is still incomplete, and the kelleroids have settled there, while the right side is mining crystals, which is what the terronoids are doing at the moment. By the way, blazeroids have recently infiltrated the base and they've already built their base and a couple of factories, but they don't have any robots to guard them yet, which gives you a chance to get them under your control quickly. Go, ranger, don't slow down or you'll miss your chance to win!

        GovTextLoss=Woefully sorry, <Player>, you were unable to complete the mission and lost the battle. We will not condemn you for your defeat, for you are not a warrior, but a merchant, and you did the best you could. For the time lost in trying to help us, accept the modest sum of <Money> cr., that's all that's left in the accounts of the "Country House" after paying fines for unfulfilled contracts. Government troops will now take over the business of destroying the Dominators and our company will be declared bankrupt. Farewell!
        GovTextStart=Dear Ranger <Player>, our company "Country House", engaged in the modification of combat dominators robots into agricultural machines, offers you to perform a special task. The fact is that, through the employees' inattention, several robots managed to free themselves and seized the factory of the production of agricultural machinery, which, incidentally, is located underground. The surviving staff told us that the dominators are currently fighting each other in the factory, destroying expensive equipment belonging to the company, and if they are not stopped, soon there will be nothing but ruins left. As a true merchant, you must understand that if we are left without a factory, our company will not be able to fulfill our contracts, and therefore it will be declared bankrupt. We are prepared to pay you a large sum of money to kill the Dominators which have broken free and put the factory back under our control. If you agree to help, you will receive additional information at the place of battle, where you will be taken immediately.
        GovTextWin=Ranger <Player >, on behalf of the management of the company "Country House" I congratulate you on the successful completion of the task and give you a reward in the amount of <Money> cr.! The bosses of the company are very pleased and asked me to tell you that if you want to engage in the sale of agricultural machinery, you can buy it from us at great discounts. Best of luck and prosperity to your business!

        RobotsStart=Commander <Player>!
        RobotsStart=With the help of the staff, we managed to build a small base for the production of combat robots, which we put under your control. At the beginning of the battle, we recommend to capture a few factories located directly at the entrance before the dominators do it. Try not to use atomic weapons to save the remaining factory equipment. Good luck!
        RobotsWin=Unbelievably, you managed to win, and now the factory is back under our control! A company representative is already waiting for you at the government building to present you with your award.

        GovTextLoss=Too bad, <Player>, you didn't make it. Although you did us a favor by your defeat, because the island is now completely owned by the dominators and it's unlikely anyone will go there to get the treasure. And until we figure out how to get rid of those robots, we'll sell videos of the battle you organized. So our government will even pay you a small bonus of <Money> cr. Goodbye, ranger.
        GovTextStart=Hello <Player>! Tell me, are you into history and archaeology? Well, honey, why are you leaving, huh? Have you heard that you can make money in archaeology? I see, I see in your eyes that you know something about dark excavations! Well, we found a mound here, gaalian, apparently. Turns out that these Gaalian sycophants, ugh, I mean scrupulous, lived on <Planet> before us. And now they want all the goodies their ancestors buried here. But come on, how could we Pelengs pass up such a chance to find out more about the past of those scum-sucking, dishonest Gaalians, and see if there's any dirt on them! All right, I've gone a little crazy, just be cool, just be cool... Hmm, what am I talking about? Oh yes, you, as a famous pirate, are offered a job from a local firm - Blackdiggers, for the examination of these very mounds. I'll tell you right away, 25% of everything of value you find is yours, plus standard pay from the firm. If you agree, we'll take you immediately to the excavation site.
        GovTextWin=You're good, <Player>, on behalf of the leadership of Dzuhallag congratulate you on the successful completion of the task! Blackdiggers is just a cover, and you believed in it... Anyway, here's your <Money> cr, you've honestly earned it. Now the Gaalians will pay us 1000 times more for the archaeological finds in those mounds. Best of luck, and try not to talk about it...

        RobotsStart=No, I'm definitely angry, very angry! Turns out the Dominators landed there, too, next to the mounds! And now you, <Player>, have to destroy them to start digging. Not only that, some ranger tried to get hold of the treasure without our permission, but apparently the Dominators prevented him, hehe, his downed ship now lies in the middle of the island. The ranger did manage to take over the base and several factories before he died, take them under your command immediately! Let's go, more action, less words!
        RobotsWin=You won! We believed in you! Sh-what? One mound destroyed?! I will spit on you for making such sh-jokes! Hurry back to the government building before you blow up all the treasures.

        GovTextLoss=Eh, trouble, trouble... Now we'll have to spend the rest of our days in the dark, with the heartbreaking screams of our poor children. At least, <Player>, at least you honestly fought to the end, trying to help us, at least take these <Money> cr. And fly away soon, but please don't turn on the floodlights when you start, remember that our population is bound to come to the light source, and seeing you leave the planet they may think that you just run away like a coward, leaving them to their fate, and then we do not guarantee your life, offended people can be very cruel...
        GovTextStart=Come in, come in, don't be shy, I'll put another light bulb in, I can't see your face. Ok, that's better... As you may have noticed, dear <Player>, we have a power shortage here. You see, the thing is, our planet revolves around its axis with the same period as around our star, so half of the planet is always lit by the sun and the other half is not. But it's even better, because if <Planet> rotated, there would be no life on it. What can you do, we always have night, darkness. And have you heard such an ancient human saying - "Darkness is a friend of youth"? Yes, yes, that's why we have such a high population growth rate! So, our entire power supply system depends on solar panels located on the illuminated side of the planet, and the main generators and power transmission stations are on a small island located on the border of light and shadow. And here's the problem, it's the island that the dominators chose to set up their bases. Apparently, they were lured by the large amount of energy available. As a result of their invasion, we have practically lost the light in the cities, and now the rate of population growth will increase even more... Where, one wonders, are we going to put such a pile of people, huh? They will flood the whole planet! I beg you, do us a favor and save us from a population explosion by destroying the dominators. As a reward, the government will pay you a tidy sum... What is this, rounded shapes everywhere... Anyway, we'll pay you very well for a successful mission! So, do you agree?
        GovTextWin=Thank you, <Player>, you've done us an invaluable service! You not only have restored power to our homes, but you've also saved us from overpopulation. That deserves all the praise it can get. Here's your well-deserved <Money> cr. Well, well, thank you again and see you later! Oh no, wait, I get word that there's a special gift for you... Um... Here, please, at least take a couple of kids to raise... You see, while you were dealing with the Dominators on that island, the population has risen to a critical maximum, and since you've decided to help us, then... Wait a minute, where are you... I was just kidding...

        RobotsStart=Commander <Player>!
        RobotsStart=There are currently two series of dominators on the island: the Kelleroids and the Blazeroids. While they were fighting each other, trying to get as much power under their control as possible, our special forces managed to capture a robot manufacturing base, where we even managed to build one robot with extremely powerful weapons. We put the base and the robot under your command, use them to defeat the enemy. Go, ranger!

With your planetary circus, you have disgraced the honor of our supreme ruler's chief advisor, my honor, earned through hundreds of sabotage and years of exquisite torture! I will have to start all over again. I hope you won't tell anyone about my mistake. I'll even give you a <Money> cr for your silence. What? That's not enough?! Don't you want to get hit in the face? As a bonus! Get out, you unworthy one! May weakness be with you!
        GovTextStart=Yes, we have an assignment for a real ranger... You are real, aren't you? Let me feel you. Now, now, don't laugh so wildly. Well, dear Executioner... ugh... <Player>, although you're all the same... ...hmm... face, our deeply respected ruler, beloved by all the people of the planet <Planet>, works so hard and productively for the good of the Motherland, that he just burns to death at work! And he, to keep fit... so what if he weighs two centners... and immoral qualities, he just vitally needs a high quality long rest. Until last year we had to organize all sorts of trips to resorts and sanatoriums in the Galactic famous vacation spots, but then the population of our immense homeland discounted, and we managed to build a whole complex of magnificent islands on the equator of our planet. All would be well, but after the capture of our system by the Dominators and the subsequent liberation, we discovered that the islands are literally swarming with combat robots, who are constantly fighting for full possession of these magnificent products of engineering thought. Not only that... They've built an industrial complex instead of the villa we've built, and they're pumping green crap into it!!! Impertinent tincans!!! We ask, no, we demand the immediate and complete destruction of these cans... ...these hanks of wire... these... Yes, yes! Of course! The reward will pay for all your expenses! You may begin immediately! So do you agree?
        GovTextWin=Brilliant fight, brilliant victory and... A-A-A!!! Shiny crap on your back!!! Dominator spy!!! Shake it off, shake it off now! Yes, yes! And kick him by the heel! All right! Let me hit him with my gun! Oh... Let's do it again! He's not moving?
        GovTextWin=Well, okay, what were we talking about? Ah yes... With regret... that is, with great appreciation and a sense of gratitude, we present you with these humble <Money> cr as a reward for your valiant actions that resulted in the complete liberation of our wonderful artificial islands! Our great-hearted ruler is full of pride in the rangers and is already celebrating the cause in full force. The festivities include a firing demonstration, a contest of speed-eating the loser in the tera-jumping plasmacheckers, a hatchball in a minefield (by the way, they serve great kebabs there), and my all-time favorite contest - "Convince the gobzaurus to become a vegetarian"! It's true that no one has won yet, but... Why are you looking at me like that? Yes, it's the only way to keep the people in line! For their well-being, you know... How do you not share? How "unfair"? How do you "love and respect"? If you've got the money, get out of here... Come on, come on, mumble!

        RobotsStart=Commander <Player>, the situation is difficult... You have only a piece of land and six combat units at your disposal. The enemy is strong, has very fortified bases and huge reserves of resources, so do not go to the trouble and try to strangle them with each other, shooting the most spirited. Also, we lost a scout squad a couple of days ago, if you can find what's left of it, it'll be a good help for you!
        RobotsWin=Enemy defeated! Hero <Player>, congratulations!  Go back to the government building, there is a well-deserved reward waiting for you.

        GovTextLoss=Your incompetence almost caused the destruction of our entire planet, <Player> - this is completely unacceptable! Fortunately, a comparison of the information you received with the intelligence we already had, allowed us to determine the approximate location of the backup server of <color=0,50,200>terronoids</color>. It will soon be hit from orbit with an ionic strike, after which our regular troops will clear the island of all surviving machines.
        GovTextLoss=You will receive only a disapproving mark in your personnel file, and the standard compensation for your unsatisfactory work of <Money> cr. Goodbye, <Player>. I prefer not to have any dealings with you in the future.
        GovTextStart=We have had some difficulties, <Player>, and these difficulties are directly related to our common enemy, the <color=0,50,200>dominators</color>. There are many rumors throughout the Galaxy about your victories over them, both in space and on earth, which means that, under the current circumstances, you are almost the perfect candidate for us.
        GovTextStart=So, the problem is that back at the beginning of the war <color=0,50,200>Terron</color>, the control center of the "green" series, for its spread and transformation of the Galaxy into itself, has placed second order backup servers, with full backups of its own neuroconsciousness, on numerous coalition planets. Do you know what a backup is? Ah, never mind. Basically, those servers should hold all the information that the <color=0,50,200>Terron</color> himself has in his head, and if the original is destroyed, any of those secondary servers can become the new <color=0,50,200>Terron</color> and lead the series.
        GovTextStart=A year ago one such <color=0,50,200>Rakhish</color> server was found and eliminated, and judging by the data we gathered, the same server with a <color=0,50,200>86.37%</color> probability may be present on our planet. Orbital reconnaissance has detected suspicious technogenic activity on an island in the temperate ocean, and strange seismic waves are emanating from the Earth's depths beneath that island, which may indicate a transformation of our deep rocks to<color=0,50,200>Terron</color>.
        GovTextStart=It is up to you, <Player>, to find out if there is one of these servers, and if it is found, to destroy it. Well, who else isn't sor... I mean, who else could be trusted with such a dangerous reconnaissance than a brave military ranger, right?! What do you think?
        GovTextWin=Congratulations on a brilliant operation, <Player>! I suppose you don't need to explain the significance of this victory for the planet <Planet>? Our scientific council has rated your actions to eliminate the backup server of<color=0,50,200>Terron</color> as extremely effective, and that, you know, is pretty serious praise for a humanoid without a high science degree.
        GovTextWin=In the last two hours we've received reports from several inhabited planets at once. They are experiencing similar <color=0,50,200>teronoid</color> activity there, and they want to use our experience to combat this kind of threat. You may have a new job soon, <Player>.
        GovTextWin=Ah yes, I almost forgot about your reward! Take these <Money> cr. as a material appreciation of your work. I hope they will help you in your... Anyway, whatever it is you do.

        RobotsLoss=Go back to the government building. We need to know all the information you managed to obtain through your unprofessional actions.
        RobotsStart=All right, you're here. Just to give you a quick rundown: <color=255,240,100>terronoids</color> are in a fierce battle with the forces of the recently landed <color=255,240,100>blazeroids</color>, and one of their assembly bases and some of their production facilities is hidden in a low mountain dug out by <color=255,240,100>terronoids</color>. <color=255,240,100>Blazeroids</color> have also dug themselves a mountain and now they are mining resources needed for the offensive. Meanwhile, somewhere underground lurks a spare backed up <color=255,240,100>Terron</color>, supposedly looking exactly like its original on <color=255,240,100>Gralgar</color>. You've seen <color=255,240,100>Terron</color> in the holographic pictures, right? Anyway, you won't get confused.
        RobotsStart=It is very important to give the maximum attention to searching of<color=255,240,100>Terron</color>! If it turns out that there is no server here, your main task will be the complete destruction of <color=255,240,100>dominators</color> and the liberation of the island from their presence. For the mission you have our best submarine with a nuclear reactor on board, as well as two robots specially designed for this operation. And don't forget that the well-being and fate of the entire planet <Planet> may depend on the detection of this server!
        RobotsStart=Good luck, <Player>. Today you will need it.
        RobotsWin=Unbelievable! You managed to destroy the backup server! And even the false target prepared by <color=255,240,100>terronoids</color> did not deceive you. That's what a master of his profession means!
        RobotsWin=Don't worry fot the rest of the <color=255,240,100>dominators</color>, our regular forces will take care of them. It's time for you to return to the capital to give a detailed report on the work you've done. We look forward to welcoming you with open arms.

        GovTextLoss=According to the order of our ruler, I am obliged to give you this envelope with a minimum rate of <Money> cr for hired rangers. True, I would not open it if I were you. From the looks of it, he pissed in it heartily.
        GovTextLoss=By the way, that burned arboretum was where I first fell in love and found marital bliss. You can only imagine how I feel right now...
        GovTextLoss=Get off our planet, <Player>. You are no longer welcome here.
        GovTextStart=Do you, <Player>, like to stroll along the paths of a shady forest? Not holoprojects, but a real forest park, where you can enjoy a quiet rest from dangerous space adventures? Our planet provides just such an opportunity to all who wish to do so.
        GovTextStart=There is a luxurious arboretum on one of the local islands, known throughout the galaxy for its variety of green vegetation. The arboretum is open and welcomes visitors under its crown at any time. Or rather, until recent events it did...
        GovTextStart=An inexplicable thing started happening in it about a month ago. Some of the trees began to grow upward at an alarming speed, growing to enormous heights in a matter of weeks. Botanical scientists began to study the phenomenon, but it soon turned out that other scientists were also interested in the same thing... Blue in color, and made entirely of metal. At first they were not taken seriously, but when the island suddenly "grew" a whole assembly base, and <color=0,50,200>kelleroids</color> flowed a river from it, it was no laughing matter. We hastily evacuated the scientific group, staff and visitors, but <color=0,50,200>dominators</color>, by that time, completely flooded the island. And, apparently, they do not intend to share the results of their research. And the park, meanwhile, is steadily dying.
        GovTextStart=We ask you to save our green park. Of course, many rare trees will suffer during the operation, but we simply have no other choice. If you do not agree to take the lead in the operation, our ancient park, which has 600 years of history, will soon die out forever.
        GovTextWin=Good job, ranger <Player>! The variety of plants that are necessary for the complete restoration of the arboretum has been preserved, and very soon we will solve the secret of the accelerated growth of the trees too! Yes, yes, the <color=0,50,200>terronoids</color> are almost knocked out of the ground. Apparently, they were mining some obscure crystals there. What did the scientists call them? Either tiber, or tiberite... I do not remember.
        GovTextWin=Well, it doesn't matter in the end. And the important thing is that the arboretum is saved and will please us with its green groves for hundreds, and even thousands of years! And you, <Player>, waiting for a substantial cash reward in the amount of <Money> cr. Even I personally put in my "penny", so much I liked your work. As for the rest, I wish you good luck - come as the park will be restored to its former glory. You will have a proper rest there.

        RobotsLoss=Go back to the government building. I don't want to see you again, so my assistant will talk to you there. Have a nice day.
        RobotsStart=It seems the situation has changed dramatically. It turns out that <color=255,240,100>terronoids</color> were making their way around underneath the island all this time! Apparently the unstoppable growth of the trees is deal of their manipulator. When the island was filled with <color=255,240,100>kelleroids</color>, the "greens" considered it an invasion of their territory and crawled out of their holes to chase the impudents away. Well, now you obviously have to deal with two series of these "peace-loving" robots at once.
        RobotsStart=Try, however, to avoid casualties if possible. Major skirmishes threaten the well-being of local flora, so the less you use flamethrowers, plasmaguns and lasers, the better. Good luck, <Player>, but remember - it's important to try to keep as many trees intact as possible!
        RobotsWin=According to the results of the orbital scan, all <color=255,240,100>dominators</color> on the surface have been destroyed, which means nothing further threatens our arboretum... Well, almost.
        RobotsWin=There are still unknown complexes of <color=255,240,100>terronoids</color> lurking somewhere deep underground, but that's not your concern anymore. Go back to the government building for a quick report and a well-deserved award.

        GovTextLoss=You really disappointed us, <Player>. Us, and all the women who miraculously survived that meat grinder.
        GovTextLoss=<color=0,50,200>Dominators</color> have created a real massacre on that base, and you galloped to the secret exit, pushing all its valiant defenders to certain death on the way. I would even say that you are not worthy to be called a man, but who knows, maybe on your home planet such behaviour is just considered a manifestation of extreme courage.
        GovTextLoss=Either way, here are your <Money> cr. - A reward for "valiant work." The Ranger Center Network obligates us to pay for bringing people like you to work, although in my personal opinion, you deserve nothing but a spit in the face from every fighter on the execution squad. Now get out of my sight, you pathetic lowlife!
        GovTextStart=Yes, I guess we could really use your help right now.
        GovTextStart=You see, during the <color=0,50, 200>dominator</color> occupation, our planet has fallen into utter decay. The surviving population faced severe shortages of food and vital resources. In the north, where people were forced to survive on the ruins of frozen cities, a brutal criminal dictatorship was established, where the laws of life were set by the strongest. More people died from the constant skirmishes for the surviving food warehouses, supply bunkers and power plants than from the <color=0,50,200>dominators'</color> cannons. In several isolated communes there was a throwback to the Middle Ages! It got to the point that in one of the towns, the vast majority of the female population was simply exiled to an island swarming with <color=0,50,200>dominators</color> to certain death, because, in the opinion of the "ruler", they brought his "kingdom" insufficient benefit and were openly engaged in "witchcraft".
        GovTextStart=Astonishingly, however, those women managed not only to survive in unbearable conditions, but even organized their own front to fight the steely invaders! One of the "witches" turned out to be an intelligence officer and an expert in hacking computer systems. Using her skills, she managed to take control of the <color=0,50,200>dominators'</color> assembly base, and set up production of her own robots there. The other women moved there and began to help maintain the base in a workable and, importantly, combat-ready condition as much as they could. Engineers, technicians, scientists - all the skills for which they had been exiled came in handy in these brutal conditions more than ever.
        GovTextStart=Unfortunately, attempts to take back the island from the <color=0,50,200>dominators</color> were unsuccessful. The resources produced by the base were barely enough for defense, and there were, alas, no combat tacticians among those women. But there is one combat tactician standing in front of me right now. You, <Player>.
        GovTextStart=We want to assign you not just to free that island, but to rescue the poor exhausted women from their icy captivity. So far they have managed to successfully contain the onslaught of the enemy, but the synthetic mind is indefatigable, but the human brain is not. Under such circumstances, it is only a question of time before the defenses of our fighting ladies give up. And something tells me their time is running out. Do not delay, <Player>. Hundreds of lives literally depend on your intervention right now!
        GovTextWin=Let me congratulate you, <Player>, on a brilliantly conducted operation! Your brave actions are indeed worthy of a certain amount of admiration.
        GovTextWin=As for the rescued women, they're fine, sleeping well after a hard defense. By the way, while you were sitting and waiting for the ship, didn't you have a girlfriend in mind? Well, that's none in my business. The fortitude of those women in resisting the machines will serve as an example to all the humanoids of the planet <Planet>. And the happy ending of this story will inspire many desperate people to renew their fight against the invaders. Very soon our planet will be completely liberated from <color=0,50,200>dominators</color> and you, <Player>, have had a hand in this with all your courageous "heel".
        GovTextWin=And of course, what kind of rulers would we be if we let a hero go without his reward? Please accept these <Money> cr. as a token of our deepest gratitude. We wish you all the best, ranger <Player>!

        RobotsLoss=Operation Failed! You must immediately get everyone you can into the underground system of old tunnels. A small fleet has already been sent to the island to evacuate survivors, you must hold out at all costs until it arrives, do you understand?!
        RobotsStart=The situation is difficult. The female defenders have been repulsing the furious attacks of the <color=255,240,100>dominators</color> for the past week, and now they urgently need rest and healthy sleep. And then the <color=255,240,100>blazeroids</color> and <color=255,240,100>kelleroids</color> somehow conspired and decided to mount a powerful combined attack from both sides. I fear that the defenses of our lovely ladies may not be able to withstand such a blow. You, <Player>, are literally our only hope.
        RobotsStart=Unfortunately, we can not offer you any reinforcements, the weather in this harsh region now is the most un-flying. You'll have to fight with what you have. But don't worry too much, because compared to what our ladies did at the beginning of their desperate struggle, there's literally a whole army under your control now. Good luck, <Player>, a lot of lives depend on your actions now.
        RobotsWin=Great! Your tactical skills are really impressive. To be honest, we estimated the chances of your success as negligible.
        RobotsWin=The ship for the evacuation of you and the women from the island is on its way. In the meantime, you can rest easy and chat with your battle buddies. We'll be there soon.

        GovTextLoss=On behalf of all surviving members of the <color=0,50,200>Verior Parliament of the planet <Planet></color>, I offer you my official government thanks. Your help in the defense of that island was invaluable, many lives were saved due to your timely intervention. As for <color=0,50,200>dominators</color>, they do not have long to feast on the ruins of our capital. We have already requested the support of the coalition fleet ships and very soon the damned invaders will be hammered from the surface of our planet!
        GovTextLoss=Unfortunately, I can't offer you a substantial reward, all remaining funds have already been spent on rebuilding the city, but I still managed to get you a modest <Money> cr. You will also be pleased to know that your ship has been saved. It's safely hidden in a secret government hangar, <color=0,50,200>blazeroids</color> haven't even scratched the paint on it.
        GovTextLoss=Thank you again, ranger <Player>. Without your help, the consequences could have been much worse.
        GovTextStart=We're in trouble, <Player>... Serious trouble.
        GovTextStart=Taking advantage of the fact that our economy has not yet had time to recover from the dominator occupation, the <color=0,50,200>blazeroids</color> have mounted a global offensive on all fronts. Up to a certain point, we managed to contain their onslaught, but when they landed a thousands army in the ocean, our defenses finally cracked. We didn't even have normal shipboard missiles and torpedoes to conduct full-scale combat operations at sea!
        GovTextStart=But all was not yet lost. At sea, at <color=0,50,200>570</color> kilometers west of the capital, we still had the last defensive point. After taking it <color=0,50,200>blazeroids</color> will go on a main offensive, and that's when the city is definitely over. All we can do is evacuate the population and the necessary supplies to the underground shelters, but we're running out of time, and the blazeroids will break the island's defenses any minute now. If you don't hurry, millions of civilians will die. All you have to do is hold back the enemy for a while until we can complete the general evacuation. The island's robotic defenders, controlled by a standard combat program, are unable to handle the situation, and all of our strategists are busy defending the city. All our hope is with you, <Player>!
        GovTextWin=Your actions during the defense of that island will go down in history! And also in tactics textbooks for the senior command staff. Due to your outstanding success we managed not only to defend the city but to get our hands on a very powerful defensive point perfectly fortified by the dominators. The entire <color=0,50,200>blazeroid</color> forces was forced to redeploy to the siege of the island, but thanks to you we have something to answer them, so the final victory is now only a question of time.
        GovTextWin=For your heroic deed <color=0,50,200>The High Parliament of the planet <Planet></color> has ordered to pay you a generous reward of <Money> cr. Well, I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude to you personally. Brilliant work, Ranger <Player>!

        RobotsLoss=You didn't last long... But in any case, it was a truly heroic defense. Every minute you won saved hundreds of thousands of lives!
        RobotsLoss=Unfortunately, the island is no longer an obstacle for <color=255,240,100>blazeroids</color> and all of their forces will soon be moved straight to the capital. We've already strengthened the defense, but it won't last long. As soon as the battle is over, we'll send a stealth helicopter to pick you up, but until then you should have enough supplies in the bunker. Good luck, <Player>.
        RobotsStart= Look at them! Their ship only arrived seventeen minutes ago, and they've already taken over all the factories and built as many as three assembly bases! We're down to our last outpost, in the middle of the island, but as you can see, dozens of <color=255,240,100>blazeroids</color> are already on their way to storm it. Resources are catastrophically low, there are only <color=255,240,100>eight</color> robot defenders left, and there's no way the standard combat program can handle the advancing enemy! Hell, we don't even have any robots left to send a landing party - all our forces are devoted to defending the city!
        RobotsStart=We know it's asking a lot, but try to hold out under these conditions for as long as possible. As long as you defend the fort, the enemy will not be able to move the main troops to the capital. You must hold off the onslaught of <color=255,240,100>blazeroids</color> for at least half an hour. When your defenses are breached, descend into the secret tunnel, into the fortified bunker under the island. From there, we can pick you up once the fighting above has calmed down.
        RobotsWin=But how!!! That was tactically impossible!!! We only asked you to hold out a little longer, and you managed to completely destroy the enemy!
        RobotsWin=Go back to the government building as soon as possible, our strategists can't wait to see how you did it.

        GovTextLoss=On behalf of our resort agency, I apologize that your vacation was disrupted for reasons beyond the control of the parties involved. Weren't you aware of this? The agreement that you signed before you left was just a contract for a trip to our island paradise. Or did you think we wanted to give you an assignment, ha!
        GovTextLoss=Well, in general, since <color=0,50,200>dominators</color> spoiled your vacation, the agency pays for the trip. And you're even owed a small cashback from its value in the amount of <Money> cr., because here's such on the planet <Planet> idiotic laws! But you strongly do not be flattered. I will not wish you good luck before leaving and I will not shake your hand goodbye!
        GovTextStart=Ah, how nice of you to ask! Right now you have a great opportunity to relax on our best resort island. Picturesque mountain with forest, service like a five-star hotel, cocktails with umbrellas and hot tropical sunshine! A true paradise incarnate!
        GovTextStart=What? Did you ask for an assignment? Oh, right... A small <color=0,50,200>dominators'</color> base was recently discovered on the same island. Nothing serious: one assembly plant, and a few <color=0,50,200>terronoids</color> around it. Such nonsense is like two eyes for you! Or do you say: "like two fingers"? I've already forgotten alien idioms.
        GovTextWin=Well, <Player>, how was your rest? Yes, yes, I know that your vacation was not good, but how many other people's tickets you saved from return. And how many offices were emptied for the coming summer holidays, wow! I would also like to go on vacation, but now I can't - the season. And we will restore the island in no time, don't worry about it.
        GovTextWin=Well, now let's move on to your reward... Our accounting department gave you a very appetizing sum of <color=0,50,200>5,000,000</color> cr. but we can't give it to you. The whole amount went to pay the cost of the trip to our paradise, and that, as you understand, is not a cheap pleasure. Do you know how much the Rakhish willows we used to decorate the lobby of our spa center cost? Oh, right, the center is destroyed. All right, I'll give you a partial refund in <Money> cr. And be thankful that I'm nice today!

        RobotsLoss=Okay. Okay. I withdraw my impulsive claims. Go back to the government building, we'll finish our conversation there.
        RobotsStart=See for yourself what they've done to our resort dream! The picturesque mountain has been razed by <color=255,240,100>terronoids</color> to the ground, the recreation complex is now just a bare pit occupied by <color=255,240,100>kelleroids</color>, and <color=255,240,100>blazeroids</color> has ruined our best beach with his ugly fortress! No way, <Player>, they can't let that get off their manipulators! We demand that you immediately destroy these damned hard-workers once and for all!
        RobotsWin=Yes! Another victory of idleness over unrestrained labor! And don't you, <Player>, think it's ironic that we went into space a long time ago, invented artificial intelligence, but all the hard and dirty work is still not done by robots?
        RobotsWin=And by the way, don't rush back yet. You still have three hours of paradise left on your package, so I recommend spending them on the beach with a glass of margarita in hand... Unless, of course, you're embarrassed by battery acid and machine oil instead of gentle and clean azure waves.

        GovTextLoss=Well, great. You have clearly demonstrated to our company that we can never trust a boastful ranger. We hired you for the purpose of winning the "competition" of local miners and getting the best fields of the island at our disposal. You failed. Now the island is in full operation by rangers hired by <color=0,50,200>"Pump & Squeeze"</color>, and we, according to the terms of the agreement, drop out of the "competition".
        GovTextLoss=Well, as, I hope, you understand, in the current circumstances even such a pathetic reward, which I promised you earlier, is out of the question. For your useless labor I'm willing to pay you, say... <Money> cr. Should be enough for a can of cheap booze. What's popular with you rangers these days? "Makhpella Dark"? Yeah, no wonder you're all such losers.
        GovTextStart=Hmm, do you like mountains? We can offer you a wellness vacation in nature. True, you'll have to do a little " huntsman" work before your vacation...
        GovTextStart=You see, on one mountainous island of the planet <Planet> once actively mined useful ores for heavy industry. The island's deposits have since dried up, and the old quarry has been flooded and turned into a picturesque lake. Only occasionally the abandoned island was visited by curious tourists and courageous travelers. But, as we learned later, in the depths of the mountains truly priceless riches were hidden from the mining companies... Noble and rare-earth metals, uranium ore, deposits of diamonds and rubies - you couldn't count them all! And while the greedy of this world decided how best to divide among themselves this wretched little piece of land, the island quietly penetrated by insidious <color=0,50,200>dominators</color>. Naturally, the miners' differences were instantly forgotten in the face of a far more serious threat - the loss of any potential profit at all.
        GovTextStart=We suggest that you put end to the issue of the domination of these iron plunderers. If you'll get rid of them before they manage to plunder our planetary "Klondike", mining companies are obliged to pay you a sum of <Money> cr. Would you be satisfied with such an offer?
        GovTextWin=Hey, <Player>, good for you! That's what I call exemplary metal work! On behalf of the mining company <color=0,50,200>"Greedy Orester"</color> let me thank you for your, so to speak, almost unselfish help. The cleanup of the island was done flawlessly, and thanks to our mutual agreement with the other miners, from now on most of the deposits belong to us alone for the next couple of years! That's a great idea, huh? Our competitors were literally a couple of hours too late in hiring their contractor rangers!
        GovTextWin=By the way, here's your reward - <Money> cr. as promised. I have to be honest, I was discouraged when you agreed to the first "dispersal" amount without looking. After all, it's only my official weekly salary! Apparently, the rangers really are only paupers. Anyway, enjoy your "incredibly generous" reward, and in the meantime I went to get mine.

        RobotsLoss=Come back. But I wouldn't count on a warm welcome if I were you.
        RobotsStart=Well, here we are. As you can see, <color=255,240,100>dominators</color> have already managed to fortify and deploy active mining all over the island. You have only a small assembly base with a couple of turrets and an extremely limited supply of resources, so you can't expect easy victory. On the other hand, your rich combat experience will definitely give a head start over the practical but limited algorithms of <color=255,240,100>dominators</color>. It will, won't it?
        RobotsStart=We wish you good luck in the battle, and sincerely hope for a speedy success. Every second of the <color=255,240,100>dominators</color> occupation of the island is draining our... I mean, its resources.
        RobotsWin=You really are a good strategist, if you could defeat an opponent with a large numerical advantage so quickly.
        RobotsWin=Waiting for you at the government building. Uniforms... But I don't care about the uniform.

        GovTextLoss=Yes, yes, come in, don't be shy. Don't worry, I won't criticize you. We understand that the assignment was not easy, and we have no time left for vain criticism. The armed forces are about to launch a preventive nuclear strike on the island with <color=0,50,200>dominators</color>. If those robots have already made enough weapons-grade plutonium, our attack will inevitably be followed by a response. Followed by a fiery inferno, fallout, you know. And don't worry about the civilian population, they have long ago been sheltered in autonomous suborbital bunkers. They'll stay there for a week or two, until the automatic soil and atmosphere cleaners finish cleaning up. However, it will take a long time to restore cities and the ecosystem, but what else can we do.
        GovTextLoss=And you, if you don't want to be chained to the ground for the near future, go to the spaceport right now. The insurance payment of <Money> cr. has already been transferred to your account, don't worry about it. And if you ever find yourself in this situation again, do me a favor and don't screw it up.
        GovTextStart=Well, of course there is!
        GovTextStart=About a month ago we found out that our old radioactive waste repository had long since been occupied by <color=0,50,200>dominators</color>. The damned <color=0,50,200>terronoids</color> have taken up an isolated, radiation-polluted island, and have begun to "assimilate" its unpleasant for all living creatures contents with all their might. We do not know exactly what and how they do with this waste, but most likely, by means of complex physical processes they recycle it into recyclable fuel or even weapons-grade material! And, it would seem, what could be worse, but a few days ago two other <color=0,50,200>dominator</color> series unexpectedly raided the same island! And if the potential motives of the <color=0,50,200>terronoids</color> and <color=0,50,200>kelleroids</color> could still be considered conditionally moderate, the <color=0,50,200>blazeroids</color> clearly need this island for the sole purpose of destroying us.
        GovTextStart=Please, <Player>, before it's too late, lead the operation to free the wretched repository! We've already had twelve rangers fail us in this sleepless month, and the situation on the island has only gotten worse since then. Of course, we are prepared to offer a generous reward for your help. As much as <Money> cr., can you imagine? Come on, agree! As a brother in mind, I beg you!
        GovTextWin=Ah, that was just a wonderful speech, <Player>, and at the moment with the mortally wounded Penchecrakus, I even shed a tear! You really saved an entire planet today, can you imagine?! How much unique flora and fauna could have perished if we had had to send nuclear missiles to the island... Well, let's not talk about sad things, because thanks to you this misfortune escaped us safely.
        GovTextWin=What? What cake? There was no cake, <Player> - it was just a sweet little lie. But you know what certainly wasn't a lie? A huge amount of <Money> cr. transferred to your account right-now. Now! Yes, it says the transfer was successful. But you should check the balance before you leave just in case. I know our bankers!
        GovTextWin=I'll shake your brave hand again! Without you, everything could have been much worse.

        RobotsStart=The mooring was a success. Unfortunately, this barge with a small squad of robots is the only strike force we were able to mobilize on such short notice.
        RobotsStart=As you can see, the <color=255,240,100>terronoids</color> have almost complete control of the island, but the <color=255,240,100>kelleroids</color> and <color=255,240,100>blazeroids</color> have made unsuccessful attempts to capture it several times already. With each new landing, their attacks became more and more organized and fierce. At this moment, they have dropped their landing modules on the island. Synchronously, please note, as this way the chances of breaking through the <color=255,240,100>terronoid defenses</color> of both series are much higher. The same trick we decided to use with our barge, so you agreed to the mission very timely.
        RobotsStart=Your first priority is to capture the nearest assembly base. Our tacticians recommend to look at the one on the right side, but the final decision is up to you. Unfortunately, we cannot send you reinforcements. The nearest air base is too far from the island, which is reasonable given its purpose. In general, we pass complete command of the robots in your hands and wish you the best of luck in the coming battle. You may proceed.
        RobotsWin=Great job, Ranger! You were ranked <color=255,240,100>73rd</color> in tactical skills in planetary battles for a reason. We look forward to seeing you at the government building for your victory speech and to presenting you with a birthday cake.

        GovTextLoss=Well, <Player>, congratulations. You have blighted perhaps one of the most potentially significant scientific discoveries of the last thousand years! After completely capturing the platform, <color=0,50,200>kelleroids</color> built a sort of cargo barge around it and, covered by an impenetrable shield, left the planet <Planet>. They went, as it is easy to guess, in the direction of the nearest "black hole" and I doubt very much that we shall see this priceless artifact any more time!
        GovTextLoss=Well, you're pretty much screwed, and if it weren't for the intercession of the military committee, you wouldn't have these <Money> cr. Yeah, it's easy for the military to say you supposedly helped chase the <color=0,50,200>dominators</color> off the planet, but what's in it for us? The greatest mystery that lured tourists here for decades is lost forever! Go away, <Player>, I can't see your cheeky ranger grin anymore!
        GovTextStart=Well, I think we have one assignment that perfectly suits your leadership talent.
        GovTextStart=About two hundred years ago four unidentified floating objects were discovered on our planet, or rather in one of its smaller oceans. The objects were in the form of slabs slightly larger than a hatchball field and consisted of unknown to science material. These mysterious plates, moving at high speed, inexorably approached each other and soon met at the edge of an unremarkable continental shelf. Their collision provoked a powerful explosive burst of energy, generating a centripetal shock wave that defied all the laws of physics, which was able to bend the Earth's crust and form a small quadrangular island around the plates. When the dust from this amazing phenomenon subsided, and our scientists were finally able to approach the new island, it was found that all four plates had joined together into one large platform, surrounded by a protective field impervious to matter and to any radiation whatsoever.
        GovTextStart=For many years the mysterious plates have tormented the minds of the inhabitants of the planet <Planet>, and now, after hundreds of years of waiting, we have a chance to learn something new about them. A week ago, the <color=0,50,200>kelleroids</color> arrived on our planet. Covered by a meteor stream, they managed to sneak onto the island and use an unknown device to disable the shielding of the mysterious platform. What's more, the kelleroids have somehow managed to tap into the structure and begin using its internal energy and resources to build new robots and assembly bases. All our attempts to dislodge them from there were shattered by the shield, which the <color=0,50,200>kelleroids</color> turned on as soon as they detected approaching military vehicles. This went on until two other series of <color=0,50,200>dominators</color> landed on the planet.
        GovTextStart=<color=0,50,200>Terronoids</color> and <color=0,50,200>blazeroids</color> managed to overcome the impenetrable shield and engage the <color=0,50,200>kelleroids</color> somehow, during which we managed to quietly introduce a virus into one of the <color=0,50,200>dominator</color> assembly bases. As a result, we were able to gradually seize a fortified beachhead at the northwestern edge of the platform, but we never got beyond seizing the beachhead. We'll need your tactical talents to capture the entire platform, because whatever the <color=0,50,200>dominators</color> are doing, it's probably not going to end well for our planet. What do you think?
        GovTextWin=Brilliant operation, <Player>! You really are as good as they say you are! I'm happy to report that our scientists have already managed to get into the platform and do initial tests there. It appears that the technology was created long before the Gaalians were born. The structure of the plates consists of previously unseen nanocrystalline fibers, capable of storing massive energy, which they can subsequently release in the form of any matter known or unknown to science. Can you at least imagine the scale of this discovery! Our planet has attracted a lot of tourists and scientists from all over the galaxy before, and with such a material we will soon have no shortage of visitors! Unless some scientific organization takes over the entire platform... Yep.
        GovTextWin=We have submitted you to the honorary <color=0,50,200>Grygaboy Award</color> in the field of applied physics. And although the scientific council refused to give first place this year, referring to the fact that you are not a scientist and had nothing to do with this discovery, but we still managed to convince them to <color=0,50,200>49th</color> position. Here are your <Money> cr. Congratulations! Come and visit us in 1 or 2 years. Perhaps by then, with this kind of platform, our scientists will open the fifth dimension for public visits! Ah, dreams...

I hope you have something to provide as an excuse for your failure.
        RobotsStart=As you can see, the <color=255,240,100>terronoids</color> and <color=255,240,100>blazeroids</color> positions in the eastern part of the platform are significantly worse fortified than the <color=255,240,100>kelleroids</color> base in the south. This makes sense, as the <color=255,240,100>kelleroids</color> arrived on the island first, having successfully reconfigured the "infrastructure" of the place to suit their needs. Your main task is to destroy <color=255,240,100>dominators</color>, but we would also like to save the unusual structure in the center of the platform if possible. We believe that with this device the <color=255,240,100>kelleroids</color> can control the outer shield of the island. If the device is destroyed, we may never be able to solve the mystery of this amazing place again.
        RobotsStart=Good luck, <Player>. You will need it in this battle.
        RobotsWin=Great! We didn't trust you to do this for no reason. A team of technicians and scientists are on their way to the platform, and a blank detailed report and a cup of our best unrefrigeratable coffee are waiting for you in the government.

        GovTextLoss=This defeat is not your fault, <Player>. No one expected more from such a desperate attempt anyway. To liberate an entire archipelago with just three robots, really? Pfft! That's ridiculous. By the way, our bombers have already begun methodically knocking out the <color=0,50,200>dominators</color> from their positions. The process isn't too fast, because the damn tin cans show extraordinary talent in building long-term bunkers, but our pilots know what they're doing - you can count on that. It's not clear, though, what we'll do with the bombed-out archipelago afterwards. Maybe we should turn it into a post-apocalyptic museum? Hmm, I'll have to think about that idea.
        GovTextLoss=As for you, here's the promised participation fee - <Money> cr. I recommend you rest today, and tomorrow, with fresh forces, answer the call of dawn in someone else's sky, so to speak, hehe. Anyway, best of luck.
        GovTextStart=Oh, <Player>, good thing you asked, we just have one very serious problem right now!
        GovTextStart=We decided here, then, to equip a public landscape park on the <color=0,50,200>Seazilos archipelago</color>. And then it turned out that some nasty billionaire is already fond of this archipelago for his personal indoor resort! We, of course, allowed no such thing, but the scoundrel unleashed legal proceedings against us, and when he realized that he was losing, began to threaten, referring to something incomprehensible. Soon, however, he left the planet, and we even began to forget about the incident, but no such luck!
        GovTextStart=A few weeks after his departure, a large shipment of odd-looking construction materials with peleng markings was delivered to the islands. By that time the construction of the resort had already been frozen, and the erected structures were being prepared for demolition soon, but the arrival of the shipment disrupted our plans. Literally the day after the delivery transport departed, our military radars sounded the alarm - <color=0,50,200>dominators</color>! And not just anywhere, but right in the middle of that archipelago! It turns out that under the guise of building materials, this sneaky creature sneaked real <color=0,50,200>terronoids</color> to our planet! By the time we discovered them, there were already many assembly bases ready for mass production on the islands, but that's not all!
        GovTextStart=While the <color=0,50,200>terronoids</color> were mastering the islands, other <color=0,50,200>dominators</color> were somehow able to get in there as well. And worst of all: the <color=0,50,200>kelleroids</color> managed to build a huge <color=0,50,200>remote programmer</color> capable of deactivating the assembly bases for their subsequent capture at a very long distance. And this is already, as you understand, a threat of planetary or even all-systemic scale!
        GovTextStart=By now we have already deployed a whole military operation, the first priority of which is the destruction of this most dangerous construction. We call on you, as an experienced strategist, to take command of an auxiliary squad of combat robots on the archipelago, and thereby help us by focusing all the attention of<color=0,50,200>dominators</color> on yourself.
        GovTextWin=I have to admit, the whole fight was just fine! Defeating <color=0,50,200>dominators</color> with such a small force, you saved us a lot of time and money. It looks like we didn't even get out of the original landscape park construction schedule! Truly, your arrival was a real miracle for us.
        GovTextWin=Please accept these <Money> cr. as a sign of deep gratitude of the humanoids of the planet <Planet>! Also, perhaps you will be pleased to know that the same billionaire who planted the <color=0,50,200>dominators</color> on our archipelago has been put on probation for life for treason. Now he'll know how to deal with the enemies of all intelligent life in the galaxy.

        RobotsLoss=Ha! More than expected outcome. Don't worry, it's just a couple of generals from our headquarters decided to bet on how fast you'll blow this fight.
        RobotsLoss=Go back to the government building. There's a mug of hot coffee waiting for you and a small payment for taking part in the failed operation.
        RobotsStart=While you were on your way, the situation on the islands changed dramatically. <color=255,240,100>Blazeroids</color> realized the threat to them in time and sent small and nimble <color=255,240,100>sprite saboteurs</color>  to <color=255,240,100>programmer</color> and managed to disable him unnoticed. The need for a major operation seems to have fallen away on its own. However, the <color=255,240,100>dominators</color> are still control the archipelago, so you have a great chance to show off your tactical talents in action.
        RobotsStart=Well, the situation is complicated by the fact that in addition to turning off the <color=255,240,100>programmer</color>, the <color=255,240,100>saboteurs</color> overloaded the power core of your base, after which only a few robots survived by taking refuge in an unfinished greenhouse. And yes, it's useless to ask what we build them out of. All peculiarities of greenhouses construction are kept in the military department under the <acolor=255,240,100>"Top Secret"</color>. In short, your new task is to liberate the archipelago with the forces at your disposal. Naturally, you must first capture the nearest assembly base and only then proceed to more active actions. And do not worry about possible failure. As a last resort, we will simply send a squad of supersonic bombers to the archipelago, but it would be much cheaper to make do with our existing contingent.
        RobotsWin=Whoa, so you managed to pull off this impossible task after all! Unbelievable! You've saved us a lot of money, <Player>, and thus earned a hefty raise to your fee.
        RobotsWin=We are waiting for you at the government building to sign all the formal paperwork and give you a well-deserved award.

        GovTextLoss=Well, well, don't get too excited! Honestly, our tacticians estimated the probability of success under these conditions at only <color=0,50,200>3%</color>. Few could do better than you, <Player>. You may not be the best strategist in the galaxy, but you've done your bit, so you deserve a little encouragement. Take these small <Money> cr., which we highly recommend you spend on improving your skills in ground battles.
        GovTextLoss=Well, now, as we promised, you get the rare chance to personally press the button to launch nuclear missiles aimed at the <color=0,50,200>dominator</color> bases on the surface of the satellite. We don't have to give them such a valuable resource, do we? There you go, the big red button. Well, now we can let go... That's it, the rockets are going into the sky - see? Ah, how graceful the flight of imminent death is sometimes!
        GovTextStart=Hmm, mission-mission... What kind of mission can I give you... Oh, I found it!
        GovTextStart=The deposits of valuable minerals were discovered on our planet's natural satellite quite a long time ago. For the extraction of minerals we deployed there the construction of assembly bases, on which the production of robotic miners was to be set up in the future. However, due to the satellite's boggy terrain, the underground communications were delayed, and just at this point our system was attacked by <color=0,50,200>dominators</color>.
        GovTextStart=Till the liberation of the system, all communication with the satellite was lost, and during this time some bases were captured and completed by our enemy. Now that the system is back in our hands, it's time to remind <color=0,50,200>dominators</color> that it's not okay to take what's not yours.
        GovTextStart=You, <Player>, could be put in charge of the operation to free the satellite. Are you interested?
        GovTextWin=The mission was accomplished just fine! The satellite, and the deposits of valuable minerals with it, are completely under our control again. By the way, you may be glad to know that the underground communications are finally working properly. Very soon our robotic miners will begin full-scale extraction of much-needed resources.
        GovTextWin=In the meantime, let me express my gratitude to you in tangible terms. I hope these <Money> cr. will bring you luck, as your visit to our planet did for us. From now on, you are always welcome here, <Player>.

        RobotsLoss=Go back to the planet <Planet>. We'll give you a nice cup of coffee, then you can press the button to launch your own nuclear missiles.
        RobotsStart=So, by the time you arrive one base is partially completed and operational, but we haven't been able to fully establish underground communications yet. Because of this, the initial productivity of your assembly base will suffer at first, but the technicians are working hard to solve this problem.
        RobotsStart=To keep up with the <color=255,240,100>dominators</color> robot production rate you'll have to take over several more nearby bases, or temporarily distract the enemy from your positions. As an experienced strategist, you should know best which course of action to take. We wish you good luck and go into forced radio silence mode for a while.
        RobotsWin=And once again the organic mind defeats the practical and fast, but totally deprived of operational flexibility, artificial intelligence! You, <Player>, have a real talent. Congratulations!
        RobotsWin=Go back to the planet <Planet>. Our entire Tactical Center looks forward to your detailed report.

        GovTextLoss=Ah, there you are, finally. I can't say that the scientists council was happy with the result. The expensive well is permanently sealed, and under the pressure of all sorts of crazy freaks, the chances of repeating the experiment are close to zero. Nevertheless, the plans of <color=0,50,200>dominators</color> were also thwarted, and if some of the robots survived under the rubble, they will have to fight their way to the surface for a very, very long time.
        GovTextLoss=There's your fee, <Player> - <Money> cr. I understand you probably expected a slightly higher amount from us for your labors, but we weren't entirely satisfied with the work done either. Have a nice day.
        GovTextStart=<Player>, have you ever wondered what could be under your feet? I mean, very deep beneath your feet, in the very bowels of inhabited planets. Despite all our extensive technology, we still have only a rough idea of the processes going on in the lower layers of the planetary crust and mantle. To gather more information about the composition of rocks at depths of more than fifteen kilometers, the <color=0,50,200>Prokolskaya Superdeep Well</color> was drilled on the eastern continent of the planet.
        GovTextStart=For a long time the drilling was going well, until at a certain point we encountered a series of unexplained events. First, very strange sounds of unknown origin were recorded at great depths. Then periodic collapses and movements of the structure began to occur, workers began to disappear. Some pseudoscientific organizations claimed that among the recorded sounds they were able to decipher moans and screams from hell, coming from the depths, that the well as the entire scientific project is cursed and that drilling work must be stopped immediately. Strange as it may seem, drilling was soon stopped, and the station was mothballed indefinitely. And such abandoned objects, as you know, often attract the attention of <color=0,50,200>dominators</color>.
        GovTextStart=Robots have occupied a mid-depth control mine, and we have no idea what they're doing there now. One thing is certain - we can not allow them to mastermind under our feet in any case. So if you're not afraid of devils, burning coals and pots with boiling tar - feel free to go on the operation to free the mine from the presence of <color=0,50,200>dominators</color>. For sure you will not be left without a reward.
        GovTextWin=Brilliant work, <Player>, you were recommended as one of the best tacticians for maneuvering in confined spaces for a reason. By the way, all the hype around the capture of <color=0,50,200>Prokolskaya Superdeep Well</color> has rekindled popular interest in it. Right now there is an active gathering of votes for the resumption of drilling operations. Who knows, maybe in just a couple of years we will overcome the mark of twenty kilometers, and at this depth we will not be afraid of the devil himself, hehe.
        GovTextWin=But, of course, such a success would hardly be possible without your direct participation. Please accept these <Money> cr. as a thank you for your selfless work.

        RobotsLoss=<Player>, can ...u hea... me?! Get out of the... ...ediately! I repeat, leave the mine immediately! Your firefight with the dominators has caused a destabilization of the entire continental layer, soon the entire <color=255,240,100>Prokolskaya Well</color> will be permanently blocked by powerful earthquake!!!
        RobotsStart=Now it's hard to say for sure, why this place attracted so much <color=255,240,100>dominators</color>. From the scattered data we can only assume that the <color=255,240,100>kelleroids</color> are busy gathering new information as usual, and the <color=255,240,100>blazeroids</color> are mining rare resources to build even more deadly ships. Whatever the case may be, they dig the mine thoroughly, building a bunch of factories in the process to supply their assembly bases. The worst thing in such a situation is that constant clashes between robots of different series can eventually break the integrity of the vaults of the mine, which is fraught with extensive collapses and a complete blockage of the well channel.
        RobotsStart=Your base, located just outside the deepening canal, is far enough away from enemy positions that should give you time to gather the necessary forces and then systematically squeeze <color=255,240,100>dominators</color> from their holes. The main objective remains the complete elimination of the <color=255,240,100>dominator</color> threat, but be aware that the destruction of the mine is unacceptable under the circumstances. Try, if possible, to avoid unnecessary firing.
        RobotsWin=You did an excellent job, <Player>. Our scanners do not register any active <color=255,240,100>dominator</color> signatures.
        RobotsWin=We recommend, however, not to stay too long in the depths. Who knows what other secrets conceal this dark and hot world.

        GovTextLoss=Well, this seems to be the end of us. No, I don't mean the end of the city--the end of our government administration. Our handling of the dangerous accident has been deemed unsatisfactory, so we're going on an indefinite vacation to some remote resort planet. And guess what? It's not so bad after all. At least you don't have to watch the whole town first descend into drinking their own urine, then vampirism, and then... Who knows? Not me, anyway.
        GovTextLoss=Take <Money> cr. - the standard amount of an advance for outsourcing. Also, I don't recommend that you stay on this planet too long. Before I resigned, I officially declared you the responsible for all our current woes. Otherwise, the people simply wouldn't let me leave this building. Anyway, good luck, and these armed guys are now kindly escorting you towards the exit. Oh, and by the way, I want you to know... I'm not the least bit sorry.
        GovTextStart=Guess, <Player>, what color water is now flowing from the taps in our capital city? Clean and clear? Green? Red? Oh, that's right! Our water now has a fascinating dirty red color, and inexpressible taste of metallic rust. To drink such beauty would be only the most fucked up and at the same time reckless aesthete, which unfortunately I am not, as well as all other residents of the city. However, in the government building we have an industrial Maloq water filter <color=0,50,200>"Crap-in-Crystal"</color>, so you can not worry about the quality of your coffee. But keep in mind - such a miracle equipment is a luxury, even for the wealthy capital. So where was I going with all this? Oh yes, you can help us to solve this problem! Not for free, of course.
        GovTextStart=That's what this is all about. Our city draws its drinking water from the <color=0,50,200>North Trash Reservoir</color>. In the middle of this reservoir is a small island, formerly a dumping ground for construction waste, artificially reinforced and covered with fertile soil. On that island is our main water cleaning station, which supplies water purified of harmful impurities to our kitchen taps. Or rather, used to supply it.
        GovTextStart=Some day before yesterday there was an accident at the plant. Suddenly invaded the island <color=0,50,200>dominators</color> destroyed the tanks with a highly acidic composition filtering water. Acid soaked the ground and corroded the pipes of the station and other structures of the complex. The untreated dirt that flowed into the sump turned the soil and water red. In addition to rust, however, such water contains poisonous salts of heavy metals, and to restore order at the station, we'll have to first wrest the entire island from the damned <color=0,50,200>dominators</color>.
        GovTextStart=And don't look at my carefree look. The incoming water quality situation is getting worse by the hour, so soon even the famous Maloq <color=0,50,200>Crap-in-Crystal</color> won't be able to help us. Please, <Player>, don't deny us this desperate request! Think of the children suffering without a warm bath!
        GovTextWin=On behalf of all the jubilant citizens, let me congratulate you on this outstanding success! You, <Player>, have today brought deliverance to a multitude of those who suffer and are still preparing to accept this suffering, thus earning yourself an eternal place in our electronic glory table under the number... <color=0,50,200>38951</color>. Yeah, that's a long way off. But in any case, it's a very honorable place, and I suggest you celebrate it with this cup of clean, this time already re-filtered coffee. You don't want it? Well, that's your right. To be honest, our technicians haven't managed to fully restore the water treatment plant yet, so this coffee would hardly do you any good anyway.
        GovTextWin=Well, congratulations aside, let's move on to your immediate reward. A hefty sum of <Money> cr. has just been transferred to your account without paying any taxes whatsoever. After all, you are now our local hero and to charge you a formal penny would be extremely impolite. Now, if you'll excuse me, I must publicly accept the laurels for the miraculous deliverance of the city from a very recent and very serious ecological disaster.

It seems that <color=255,240,100>dominators</color> have contaminated another waterblock with acid! You were the only one who could have prevented this, <Player>, but now you have to flee yourself from this unfortunate island.
        RobotsLoss=Go back to the government building, there's nothing you can fix here.
        RobotsStart=Damn it! We didn't warn the technicians in time that the soil on this island is extremely unstable, and as a result, our assembly base went underground while we were still installing it. Only a handful of combat robots landed as support remained under your control, but all is not lost! The best on-duty tacticians in our headquarters were able to quickly develop a new plan. Here's a summary of it:
        RobotsStart=<color=255,240,100>Terronoids</color>, the first to arrive on the island, collected the local junk and built a fortified base from it, and <color=255,240,100>blazeroids</color> took over what was left and immediately began to press the trenched. While the terronoids defended, shifts in the ground on the mountain caused one of their assembly bases and several of the surrounding factories to crash, and that base becomes your primary target. You are advised to capture it quickly and hold it until fresh reinforcements are dispatched. You can plan further actions on your own. Good luck, <Player>.
        RobotsWin=Great job, <Player>! <color=255,240,100>Dominators</color> have pretty badly damaged our wastewater treatment plant, but thanks to your timely intervention, permanent damage to the stability of the island was avoided.
        RobotsWin=We, or rather our entire capital city, await your return with open arms. Tonight, the evening program includes fireworks and mass dousing with a strategic supply of mineral water!

        GovTextLoss=Well, <Player>, the news for you are not encouraging. Who exactly won the game is not so important now. At the height of the broadcast, all of our cameras suddenly went out, and the main transmitting satellite signal was down. Coincidence? I don't think so. It smells like a hacker attack. And don't smile like that! You've been scanned eight times already for devices that could have been used for such a hack. This is the last check... Yeah, looks like it wasn't you after all.
        GovTextLoss=In any case, the technicians were unable to restore the connection in time, which caused the tech support department to lose their award completely, and many of the employees were fired altogether. However, since you specifically did try, here's a small fee of <Money> cr. Have a nice day.
        GovTextStart=<Player>, you get a great chance to earn some big money. The work is not difficult - you'll just have to watch the movement of robots. That's right, just watch. As far as we know, you're pretty good at modular robots.
        GovTextStart=Nearly on our planet has become a very unusual game of chance. It is about the so-called <color=0,50,200>"Game of Domiki"</color>. In a special symmetrical arena against each other, three series of real <color=0,50,200>dominators</color> and combat robots of the Coalition. The game continues until the complete victory of one of the warring parties. Bets are placed for each side before the game begins, and whoever is lucky enough to bet on the winner gets their bet back in double figures.
        GovTextStart=Your task is to monitor the course of the battle and the behavior of the robots, as well as to record all attempts of third-party interference in the game, if any. The elimination of such interference will be the task of our specialist. Also, if you like, you can place your own bets on one of the four sides involved. So, do you agree?
        GovTextWin=Yes, it was not without reason that my late grandfather used to say, "Don't trust the betting ranger!" And yet, we managed to avoid a major scandal, and not without your direct intervention. The participants, of course, were extremely unhappy with the result, but at the same time they sincerely admired your play during the broadcast. Not everyone can get out of such a predicament, and frankly, even I was surprised by what I saw. Both the official broadcast and the third-party streams of various bloggers have collected simply astronomical amounts of donation. Our portion was more than enough to cover the losses incurred, and part of the balance in the amount of <Money> cr. was transferred to your account.
        GovTextWin=Nice reward for your fiasco, isn't it? However, as you understand, we categorically can't hire you to control the next game. Look for other <color=0,50,200>dominators</color> to beat.

        RobotsStart=Damn it, <Player>, wake up at last!!! The situation threatens to turn into a real disaster!
        RobotsStart=Most players bet on the red side, believing that <color=255,240,100>blazeroids</color> would be stronger than the others. In fact, all sides were on an even playing field, but it was the <color=255,240,100>blazeroids</color> who broke into the center of the arena first, just five minutes after the start, while the others were busy squabbling on the periphery. We don't yet know for sure if it was an accident or malicious intent. The crowd is cheering, anticipating a quick victory, but what do we do now?! A Reds victory could be the end of the entire sweepstakes!
        RobotsStart=You've got real combat experience - do something to hold them back! Send your troops into the center before the Reds take it all, but do your best to hide your own involvement in this game! And remember - if <color=255,240,100>blazeroids</color> win, your personal fee will also go under the knife.
        RobotsWin=This is a failure! A complete failure of our entire fair game! Your job was only to keep the Reds from gaining the upper hand, not to stage a victorious massacre of helpless machines! All onlookers could clearly see that the yellows weren't running a standard combat program.
        RobotsWin=Right now our bookmakers are already barely keeping the crowds of disgruntled punters at bay. You, on the other hand, head back to the government building. There we will continue our conversation.

        GovTextLoss=<color=0,50,200>Shusha</color>, satisfied with his "victory", continues to sit in his bunker on the island as if nothing had happened. We offered to help him clean up the island from the dominators in order to have a rematch, but he flatly refused.
        GovTextStart=I can offer you one very interesting competition... task, in short. The reward promises to be quite solid - a third of the fortune of the dirtiest and respectful general,<color=0,50,200>Sharachey Shusha</color>, former Minister of Defense of the planet <Planet>. Rich in his long career, he's been hosting a lot of drunken discos lately, to which our elite often fly in to relax. So, once he once in all seriousness said that he would give a large sum of money to the one who could defeat him, fighting on modular robots. <color=255,240,100>Shusha</color> claimed to be a master in strategic control, and was willing to hold a contest with any robot controller at his own expense. He even bought and specially equipped a small island for the affair, and almost officially confirmed his claim.
        GovTextStart=You, <Player>, have a great opportunity to make some easy money! Yes, the task is exactly to win such an improvised competition, but it shouldn't be the slightest bit difficult for you. So, do you agree?
        GovTextWin=The victory is yours. The fight was broadcasted on fifteen planetary and three all-galactic stereo channels at once. No wonder, it's the news of the year! <color=255,240,100>Shusha</color> stated that the fight was disrupted by a surprise attack of the Dominators, and that he was barely able to leave the island alive. Yeah, that's what "the competition" is all about.
        GovTextWin=But don't worry, we found the money for your reward after all. Not so much, of course - only <Money> cr. But we didn't promise it would be smooth, did we? Anyway, no offense.

        RobotsLoss=Well, as expected, this cheater won't give up the victory so easily. Fine.
        RobotsLoss=And you, <Player>, we're taking you back to the government building.
        RobotsStart= He's a coward, of course... It's not for nothing that he's retired.
        RobotsStart=The point is, <color=255,240,100>Shusha</color>, after seeing your track record, panicked and went to commit fraud, setting up a hack of his robots and equipment by <color=255,240,100>blazeroid</color> scout drone. It doesn't sound too believable, but somehow the real dominators showed up on the island, all the plants shut down, and some of them even had live explosives underneath them! Looks like we won't be seeing any more fair combat here. <color=255,240,100>Shusha</color>, on the other hand, is diligently pretending as if nothing of the sort happened, and has already publicly announced that he's ready to begin the first duel.
        RobotsStart=It looks like you'll have to fight him on these terms, otherwise you'll be automatically deemed defeated. Either way, you won't be left with a bounty. In case of a direct threat, evacuate to the rescue module in the south of the island. Good luck, <Player>.
        RobotsWin=Good job! This trickster, however, cleverly avoided, for which he deserves special respect. But your reward is already waiting for you in the government building.

        GovTextLoss=It looks like the problem was more serious than we thought. After your departure, the Dominators turned on scientific equipment unknown to us, which by its appearance could be called military. Aurora Borealis flared up over the island with unprecedented brightness, and our ships had almost all their electronics out of action! Most likely, they somehow learned how to manipulate this anomaly for their own purposes, which means our business is bad.
        GovTextLoss=No, we certainly don't blame you - the chances of surviving there were minimal, and then there's the frigid cold and loss of communications. Here's the amount in <Money> cr., just in case, but we'll start preparing the planet for emergency evacuation in the meantime.
        GovTextStart=<Player>, have you heard anything about <color=0,50,200>The Lawbreakers Society</color>? You probably have. And yes, it's all nonsense that they're supposedly a dangerous sect and all that. They're just a group of unofficial climate scientists who gained popularity around the middle of the <color=0,50,200>XXXII</color> century. Another wave of research into space, particularly the physical conditions on various planets, has fueled interest in studying their climate. News of weather and climate anomalies on some planets went viral throughout Galanet, leading to a widespread belief that the authorities and official science were hiding something strange in such places. You know, traces of the sixth race, hollow planets, shifting zones into other universes-all that kind of nonsense. But it's not easy to dissuade young enthusiasts from trying to see and touch everything with their own hands. And so, in the end, a society of several separate groups was formed. Climatologist-lawbreakers who study, as they call them, <color=0,50,200>lowbreaking</color> places.
        GovTextStart=In our time, while the war continues, interest in science has seriously decreased, and there is only one such group left. But these humanoids continue to be active and visit accessible worlds, with the support of billions of fans throughout the galaxy. Recently they also arrived on our planet, where an island beyond the Arctic Circle caught their attention. The temperature on that island is ten degrees cooler than on the neighboring ones, and there are also strange winds blowing and occasional unexplained mirages. It's become a big event - our entire scientific community, which has also begun research on the island, is following their findings. What if they get valuable and reliable information about the island, which we can get without a serious infusion from our own budget?
        GovTextStart=And now to the point - it turned out that on that island, deep in the snow, all this time were hiding <color=0,50,200>dominators</color>! They were also exploring the island, fighting among themselves. They dug everything there, and in addition they put devices that block communication, so that the entire expedition of lawbreakers was trapped. We want you to rescue them... For a substantial reward in <Money> cr., of course.
        GovTextWin=Wait... What's that blue all over your face, <Player>?! Are you joined lawbreakers? Ah, it's from the cold. We seem to forget to warn you that in addition to abnormal cold, there is also abnormal wind. Well, that <Money> cr. should be enough to get you cleaned up quickly. Congratulations on a successful operation - the dominators probably didn't expect to have everything taken away from them so quickly.
        GovTextWin=The anomalous ice laboratory, which we inherited from the Kelleroids, already surprises the scientists with the accumulated data, which we managed to decode, but something strange is really happening with the atmosphere above the island. The lawbreakers are already working on it. It is a pity that you are in such a hurry and you will not have time to work with them. Well, stop! I think I'm getting a little carried away with all this science...

        RobotsLoss=Our plan failed - the Dominators took advantage and completely drove us off the island. To save the expedition, which is already running out of provisions and fuel, we will have to storm the island with the fleet, which is quite risky, because the anomalies here are unpredictable.
        RobotsLoss=Return to the government building for a detailed report.
        RobotsStart=Well, it looks like we're really in the middle of nowhere. The Dominators keep jamming both radio and voice communications, but a nearby aircraft carrier platform has finally managed to establish a weak quantum channel, which is how we're getting this message to you.
        RobotsStart=The situation is extremely shitty: resources at the base are almost out, there is no normal defense, and the enemies are coming from all sides, not giving a break. All we can do is support you with relatively frequent reinforcements from the platform, but for that we need a signal receiving point connected to the base or at least to the factory. If you can hold your positions long enough, we'll gradually move a decent squad to you, but we have no concrete ideas about what to do next.
        RobotsStart=<color=255,240,100>terronoids</color> are sitting in a well-defended fortress, <color=255,240,100>kelleroids</color> have created a real laboratory for studying the properties of local ice and snow, and computer analysis of satellite data pointed out several vulnerabilities in the defense of <color=255,240,100>blazeroids</color> in the north, although so far nothing but a fortified base with turrets we can not see there. To the southeast, we landed a reconnaissance robot, but <color=255,240,100>blazeroids</color> have spared no resources to launch two self-deploying laser turrets with force shields there. Apparently, they're really afraid of something.
        RobotsStart=Well, we strongly advise you to hurry up. The Dominators are very close, and frost obviously won't wait. It'll bite your ears off, along with your brains.
        RobotsWin=Good job, <Player>! The island is completely cleared of dominators, and the lawbreakers will be able to study what survived after a heated battle.
        RobotsWin=Waiting for you at the government building for a detailed report and the subsequent presentation of a well-deserved reward.

We're going to have to blow this <color=0,50,200>Terrron</color> with thermo... *with thermonuclear booombs. The whole atm... atmosphere will be... *ickh* polluted over the place! But you... It's not your fault.
        GovTextLoss=There's money over there. <Money> cr. - take it. For mental *ickh* warmth. And that... fly... fly away...
        GovTextStart=Ranger <Player>, are you ready for a really important mission? How are you feeling? Concentration? Courage and morale? Great! In that case, we ask that you immediately join the secret operation <color=0,50,200>Elephant</color>.
        GovTextStart=I'll get right to the point. <color=0,50,200>Dominators</color> of <color=0,50,200>terron</color> series is not the first time trying to create a backup command server in the bowels of one of the planets under our control. The situation is tense - <color=0,50,200>terronoids</color> have already built a new server and have a lot of construction material, which will soon be used to build a well-fortified underground bunker. For this they chose one of the most remote islands in the ocean, which, in fact, allowed them to successfully avoid our detection for a long time.
        GovTextStart=We urgently need to destroy this object by any available methods. The assembly base is already activated and waiting for its commander. Let me know when you are ready to go to the action site.
        GovTextWin=Hmm. Are you sure you're a ranger? Stand over here... **viuuuummmmm** Yes, everything seems to be fine. Don't be alarmed, it was just a standard check for the <color=0,50,200>terronoid</color> nanovirus that destroyed almost all the organics on that island. Now that the server has been destroyed, we should have no trouble eliminating the centers of its spreading in the sediment.
        GovTextWin=Now let me express my sincere congratulations. I admire your selfless work in such stressful conditions. More importantly, what pressure! Bam!!! And the underactivated <color=0,50,200>Terron</color> is blown to pieces in a clouds of smoke and flame! That's how you hit them, huh?! But, ahem, I got a little carried away...
        GovTextWin=This is your reward, <Money> cr. It's a pittance compared to the number of lives you saved, of course. And by the way, I have one more surprise for you... The citizens of the capital decided on their own initiative to throw a party in your honor! You see? Over there, they're even setting off fireworks. And look over there! It's a real parade! White horses marching on the pavement - beautiful!

For now, the only thing holding them back is the occasional <color=255,240,100>blazeroids</color> attacks, which control most of the island.

        RobotsStart=We have to hurry. The process of organic destruction and transformation of the island is already in full swing. Staying here longer than necessary is simply dangerous now. At the <color=255,240,100>terronoid</color>base, north of your position, is our main target. Destroy it!
        RobotsWin=You're a genius, <Player> - you're just a real genius!!! I can't believe it. I just saw our entire planet saved from destruction. What about the planet - the entire star system could be in the steel clutches of these soulless machines!

        GovTextLoss=Well, are you happy with yourself? Ranger <Player> is a master of his craft, ha! Even our cadets could do better! Because of your incompetence, the<color=0,50,200>"Ice Mine"</color> no longer exists. It will be years before we can resume production at least <color=0,50,200>30%</color> of its former level. And I'm not even talking about the cost of decontaminating the area and building a new complex. Hell, it's more profitable for us to shoot down asteroids in orbit now!
        GovTextLoss=Well, screw you, <Player>, with your military experience. Oh yeah, I almost forgot, this is for you. <Money> cr., which you don't deserve and which will have to fuel your guilt for at least the whole trip from the government building to your starship. We won't hire such an oaf a second time, you can be sure of that!
        GovTextStart=Oh, <Player>, you're just in time! Some time ago <color=0,50,200>dominators</color> took over the <color=0,50,200>"Ice Mine",</color> and now we urgently need the help of a skilled tactician to fight it off before the damn tin cans get all the resources out of there. Oh yeah, you don't know what the<color=0,50,200>"Ice Mine"</color> we're talking about.
        GovTextStart=The <color=0,50,200>"Ice Mine"</color> is an extremely mineral-rich ore complex located at the south pole of the planet <Planet>, on a small island in the middle of the <color=0,50,200>Ice Sea</color>. And before you ask, no, that sea isn't freezing, just some creativity-deprived geographer's idea of calling it that.
        GovTextStart=In general, this very complex is practically irreplaceable for our planet, and if you agree to help us, in case of success you can expect a generous reward of <Money> cr. Just please - agree soon! Every minute the drilling rigs of the <color=0,50,200>dominators</color> are digging deeper and deeper into our underground riches!
        GovTextWin=Good job by a great ranger! You've completely lived up to the expectations placed on you, <Player>! The complex <color=0,50,200>"Ice Mine"</color> is ours again and will soon be back in action. Maybe even have time to resume production for <color = 0,50,200> Day of the miner </color>! By the way, the capture of the island by the Dominators ended up being to our advantage. The equipment survived after the liberation of the mines is superior to our own models many times over. We don't think we'll be able to produce any analogues in the near future, but the equipment we have should be enough for the years of super-efficient mining.
        GovTextWin=Well, <Player>, you get the promised <Money> cr. and a big thank you from the happy miners of the <color=0,50,200>"Ice Mine"</color> complex!

        RobotsLoss=You have fifteen minutes to leave the island before a tactical nuclear strike blows the place to pieces of expensive rock.
        RobotsStart=As you can see, <Player>, we've managed to take control of an abandoned base in the hills, and even made a daring raid to take over one factory. Unfortunately, that's where our luck ended.
        RobotsStart=<color=255,240,100>Blazeroids</color> quickly recognized a potential threat in our base and sent a strike force to take over the base in the empty orehouse to the south. To the east, you can see the elevator drop into the mines, for which a heated battle is currently taking place. Farther east is the port from which the purified ore used to be shipped to the mainland, and which is currently controlled by <color=255,240,100>Blazer</color>. Well, in the easternmost part of the island there is a large ore purification plant, on the territory of which <color=255,240,100>Keller</color> has set up his main base.
        RobotsStart=We understand that the situation is extremely difficult and the odds are clearly not in our favor, but that's why we asked for help from a professional. We only recommend you to take a look at the abandoned coastal base to the southwest of your current position and wish you luck in relocating the <color=255,240,100>dominators</color> straight to cybernetic hell! Fortunately our mines are deep, so it won't take long to dig to it.
        RobotsWin=Great job, <Player>! Yes, by your actions we can write textbooks! <color=255,240,100>Dominators</color> are completely knocked out of the island's surface, and our combat miners have already begun clearing the tunnels and adits of robots cut off from their command-assembly bases.

Do you have any idea what your failure will cost me?! There's a shipment of drugs worth 3,000,000 cr at the dock where your ship is parked, that's been sitting in storage for a week. Three fucking <color=0,50,200>MILLION</color> credits. And you see, there's a ship parked nearby with shaded windshields. THIS is just the owner of those millions, who came to check the safety of his property. AND HE'S NOT GOING TO BE HAPPY ABOUT WHAT HE SEES, DO YOU UNDERSTAND?!?
        GovTextLoss=Here, <Money> cr. - take it. The standard amount the Ranger Centers have obligated us to pay for each, even if unsuccessful, ranger's involvement in the sweep of the planet from the forces of the <color=0,50,200>dominators</color>. You got it? Now get the fuck out of here! Oh, and you don't have to close the door behind you.
        GovTextStart=Yes, we have one thing in mind... You see, there is a remote island on our planet, beyond the Arctic Circle. It's all just rocks and ice - nothing remarkable. But what is remarkable about it, specifically for us, is the stable, <color=0,50,200>24/7</color> freezing cold. Do you know how much the steady cold is costing our taxpayers? You don't know, because I'm the one stealing the money from the budget, not you. Anyway, we had the idea of setting up a convenient storage facility on that island for all sorts of... ahem, useful, but perishable "products", and then it turned out that this island has already occupied by <color=0,50,200>dominators</color> base. I do not know what these tiners could need in that icy hollows, but we do not intend to put up with the presence of pests in our own "refrigerator". And that's where you come in.
        GovTextStart=Smash the <color=0,50,200>dominators</color> and drive them off our island there, we'll never hear from them again! And we'll give you some earmarked cr from the budget. One hospital more or one less, what's the difference? But the "refrigerator", it's for every decent smug... or rather, a humanoid needs one.
        GovTextWin=Ah, there he is, our hero of the day! How are you feeling? Have you caught a cold? I've been told it's awfully cold in our new vault. Ah, what could be more wonderful than water freezing in a glass in seconds without the use of any artificial cooler?
        GovTextWin=Now, let's drop the formalities and get down to business. You, <Player>, have heard something that you shouldn't have heard. For that, you'll get something from me personally that you don't really deserve, but that that will help you and me to reach a consensus without unnecessary... misunderstandings. So, here are the clean, tax-free, <Money> cr. They're yours. But before I hand them into your dirty little hands, remember - not a word to anyone. Do we understand each other well? Very well, then.

I was recently contacted by the Ambassador of Peleng and offered to buy the entire island and the caves for a pretty good sum of money... Under the circumstances, of course. The Dominators' presence on the island didn't embarrass him at all. It seems that at least some money our planet will get from these caves anyway. And no thanks to you!
        GovTextLoss=Here, take your guaranteed <Money> cr. and get the hell out of my office!
        GovTextStart=Hmm, I guess we do have a little task. You're a merchant, right? Good. Do you make friends with the Maloqs? Even better! We've had a little conflict with them... Yeah, well, never mind.
        GovTextStart=So, I'll cut to the chase. Would you be able to do a sweep of a complex consisting of a series of well-fortified caves for us? The thing is, the Dominators have been settling there recently. Nothing serious, just a couple of <color=0,50,200>terronoids</color> with <color=0,50,200>kelleroids</color>. But the caves themselves are extremely useful to our economy. Rare earth resources, oil, all sorts of other underground stuff. In short, the stuff we need.
        GovTextStart=For pure work done we are ready to offer you, well, let's say... <Money> cr. What do you say, deal?
        GovTextWin=You're a genius! Contrary to all unexpected turns of fate managed not only to keep the fighting spirit, but also to defeat the enemy by a head! Isn't that an example to follow? And by the way, about those <color=0,50,200>blazeroids</color>... It turns out that they really were sent to our planet by the sneaky Pelengs, trying to shift the blame on the Maloqs. When we finally figured that out, we sent a message to the Maloqs, who are notoriously fond of maligning their good name. Anyway, the Pelengs got a lot of trouble now. You know what you've got a lot of now? Money.
        GovTextWin=Accept these <Money> cr. and our deepest gratitude. You have more than earned it.

        RobotsLoss=Ah, what a bitter failure! Yes, we understand that we made a mistake with the reconnaissance, but you're no better. The Dominators smashed your forces to dust! And don't even try to justify it, we saw it with our own eyes.
        RobotsLoss=Go back to the government building, but don't expect a warm welcome.
        RobotsStart=Come in, come in, <Player>, do you read me? Looks like our previous information was a little inaccurate. <color=255,240,100>Terronoids</color> and <color=255,240,100>kelleroids</color> were much stronger than we thought, but worse than that... Just five minutes ago, a ship full of <color=255,240,100>blazeroids</color> appeared out of nowhere! Imagine, a whole ship packed to the brim with ruthless robots and huge cannons! I'll bet it was those damned Maloqs who were behind it. They've been trying to squeeze this island and its caves out of us for months. Ha! They attacked the wrong humanoids!
        RobotsStart=Well, as you might have guessed, things got a lot more complicated. As soon as we heard about the appearance of <color=255,240,100>blazeroids</color>, we tried to send additional forces fo help immediately. Unfortunately, the dominator cannons took out almost all of our landing helicopters, so at this point you have to rely only on what you have. But you can still handle them, right?
        RobotsWin=Good job, <Player>! Your skills as a strategist are truly impressive. You managed not only to knock the dominators out of our caves, but to keep them in almost pristine condition, which will make future mining operations much easier.
        RobotsWin=Waiting for you in the government building with a report and a cup of coffee. On us.

        GovTextLoss=Because of your failure, all our research will now fall into the steel clutches of the <color=0,50,200>dominators</color>! Do you have any idea how badly you have failed our planet?! Thirty years of research and development just went down the drain.
        GovTextLoss=We are very disappointed in you, <Player>! You were recommended as a good specialist, and in fact you're not even worth these <Money> cr.! Yes, yes, here are your miserable money. I'd throw them in your face, but I won't, because our office might be under surveillance, and I don't want the press to know about your mission. So take the money and go to hell! I can't see you anymore!
        GovTextStart=You want a secret mission? We have one! Only it's very, very secret, so no one but the humanoids in our government can hear a word about it.
        GovTextStart=According to your track record, you <Player> are good at eliminating dominators not only from space, but also from the surface of inhabited planets. So, we have one small island that needs a professional cleanup by an experienced ranger. You wonder, why don't we send regular troops there? Very simply - the island is secret! To be more exact, the scientific-industrial complex built on it, where our scientists develop new secret weaponry and equipment. In fact, the this equipment just attracted the attention of <color=0,50,200>dominators</color>. But we resolutely do not want to share our secret projects with these metal dummies! And just for this purpose we need your help.
        GovTextStart=So, do you agree to clean up the island as soon as possible and without any information leaks? For our part, we undertake to pay you <Money> cr. upon execution. In cash and without a transfer check, of course.
        GovTextWin=<Player>, let me congratulate you, the task is done just fine! <color=0,50,200>Dominators</color> destroyed, no one guessed anything - perfect! You made a lot of noise there, so we even had to announce on the news channels about unscheduled nuclear tests, but now no one will try to get to that island for the next twenty years.
        GovTextWin=Anyway, thank you very much again! And take these <Money> cr. as a thank you for your work. Next time we need an effective but silent agent, you'll be the first one we contact.

Thankfully, we've managed to make a few subtle mistakes in time, so the whole place could literally blow up in a couple of hours.
        RobotsLoss=Waiting for you at the government building with the guilt... that is, with a report of unsatisfactory work done.
        RobotsStart=Welcome to our improvised secret fort. We set it up in a hurry, so don't mind us. Not far from the fort there's a former <color=255,240,100>terronoids</color> base that our hackers managed to disable. We recommend that you focus your attention on that as long as <color=255,240,100>blazeroids</color> and <color=255,240,100>kelleroids</color> are taking all the attention.
        RobotsStart=Now as for the overall balance of power... <color=255,240,100>Keller</color> took over the marine division, <color=255,240,100>Terron</color> liked our underground crawlers, and <color=255,240,100>Blazer</color> took over the design bureau for airplanes and other aeronautical vehicles that is the most secure place on the whole island. The situation is extremely difficult, and if the Dominators get their hands on our designs, it could turn into a major planetary catastrophe! Very much hope for your professionalism, <Player> - don't let us down.
        RobotsStart=Oh, and do I need to remind you that according to the <color=255,240,100>contract</color> you signed in the helicopter, you have no right to disclose any information regarding this island on pain of death, anathema, and throwing your ship into the mouth of an active volcano? Just concerned for your safety.
        RobotsWin=Good job, <Player>! Judging by the scanners, the Dominators are completely knocked off the island, and all systems of the complex are back under our control. Thanks to the Dominators' curiosity and your interference, our scientists have plenty of alien material for various experiments.
        RobotsWin=Waiting for you at the government building for a modest triumph. After all, there is no way we can reveal information about your mission.

        GovTextStart=That's right, human, we've got a task for you. Perhaps you have a... Can't we be on a first-name basis? Well, the Matrix, an old factory that produces parts for interactive screens and holoplates for the government of <color=0,50,200>Earth</color> and other planets serves another purpose.
        GovTextStart=Some fun stuff we produce there. Yes, ranger, drugs it is, you might as well not say out loud. All that "stuff" we used to improve our planet's diplomacy with the humans in exchange for your equipment and, OH MY PENCHECRAKUS, Gaalian technology. These are the kinds of chains we create for the good of our society.
        GovTextStart=And now it's come to our attention that the entire plant has been evacuated because of the Dominators. These bastards have tampered the programming code, and have started to replicate their parasites.
        GovTextStart=As you understand, the loss of such an important element in our economy and politics cannot be tolerated. Save the factory. Lead a takeover of the main production units - as one important worker said. If you want to, after all.
        GovTextWin=Knew that you were the perfect candidate to save the plant. As it turned out, it was sabotage on the part of the Maloqs. I don't believe those thugs could have hacked in on their own, otherwise I have questions for people's programmers. But you did a great job.
        GovTextWin=Your money will be <Money> cr. It's small compared to the work you've done, of course, but some human governments have already started to protest the delays in delivery. Confidence in your race would be pumped up, sweetheart.

Remember, you don't need to destroy the complex, you need to intercept the production buildings at these points. Get to it! I'm waiting with good news.

        GovTextLoss=Well, ranger, even though you lost, you fought as hard as you could. Although you're not much of a strategist, we decided to give you a <Money> cr for your bravery. But that's a lot less than what you would have gotten for a successful operation.
        GovTextStart=Yes, there is a rather difficult and demanding task.
        GovTextStart=So recently we discovered an interesting structure inside a mountain on one of our moons. After nearly four months of research, our scientists found out that it is a military factory, and a very old one. It is something like a thousand years old. The most interesting thing is that all the structures are still in perfect condition. Our scientists found out that the secret of such an unusual life span is the use of metal from the other arm of the galaxy - foknarite.
        GovTextStart=Our research has stagnated, however, because of the sudden arrival of <clr>terronoids<clrEnd>. As it turns out, they use the metal to reproduce their own kind. Our scientists have urgently begun an evacuation, but the loss of the plant could cost us the great scientific discovery of the millennium. So we ask that you take part in a liberation operation against the <clr>dominators<clrEnd>. The reward is appropriate. Agree.
        GovTextWin=And here comes our glorious hero, <Player>. The operation to clean up the complex went just fine, even the ancient equipment was not damaged. Get your reward - <Money> cr. Your name will be forever written in the history of our planet.

At least for trying to beat that damn hacker, we'll pay you <Money> cr. Now pack up, <Player>, you and I are no longer welcome on this planet... Although it's going to be a lot harder for me now...
        GovTextStart=So, mission you say? Well, then let me put it to you straight - do you know how to command robots? Experienced warrior. Great. Then I'll fill you in.
        GovTextStart=A couple of years ago on our planet, in an underground cave, we discovered, who would have thought, deposits of protoplasm, and quite unique, makhpellic. It may have collected on the planet after it was sort of "cleaned up", you remember what was going on with the planets back then, right? Weeell, that plasma had the unique property of making the Peleng incredibly intelligent and able to calculate what seemed to be a cosmophysics problem in a matter of hours. Nothing bad would have happened, but this nasty stuff had a side effect-it completely killed the visual pigment in his eyes. Specialists strictly forbade the use of protoplasm as food, and it would seem that this should have been the end of the study of the deposits.
        GovTextStart=But I decided that such a substance shouldn't just lie idle. I'm not a fiend to just leave it lying around! So I set up a secret organization called "Y Short". It produced protoplasm under the guise of an ordinary medical company and sold it as ordinary vitamins... Don't look at me like that, <Player>, I'm doing it for the good of the pelengs!
        GovTextStart=What's the problem, you ask? The election is coming up, and some rat from another party has decided to make light of the "problem," thus preparing to commit debauchery. That's why I want a skilled warrior like you to show me that it's not okay to balk at someone else's (even though it's not legal) things. Agreed?
        GovTextWin=Ha-ha, damn idiots! Now you'll know what it's like to pry into someone else's business. <Player>, great job! Didn't expect such an undisputed victory.
        GovTextWin=What? Don't judge me, everyone should have their own business, who better than a ranger to understand that. We can report back to your homeland too, how you've been selling drugs to pelengs? That's right.
        GovTextWin=Reward? Oh, yeah. Keep your <Money> cr. and your mouth shut. Now go, I have a campaign to get ready for.

So, <Player>, we give you the most comfortable area with turrets in the center, from where you'll conduct your "rescue operation".

Next time we'll turn to a more experienced ranger. You, on the other hand, are entitled to a consolation reward of <Money> cr. You are free to go.
        GovTextStart=Mission? Well, let's take a look at your dossier first. Not bad, not bad at all. I think you're the right man for the job. You see, <Player>, we are in urgent need of an expert in controlling combat robots. Not long ago, we spotted blazeroids landing on a research station in the middle of the ocean, codenamed "Ocean-8". Fortunately, there were no scientists there at the time of the invasion, as ocean research is seasonal. I can't imagine why the Dominators would want to land in such a remote place. However, we still need to get rid of them, and it is desirable to keep the research complex intact. The task is not difficult, agree to it.
        GovTextWin=Congratulations on your confident victory, <Player>, your brave tactical decisions are worthy to go into the textbooks. Let me thank you with an impressive amount of <Money> cr. We will recommend your candidacy to the governments of other planets in the future.

        GovTextLoss=We've studied your report. Yes, the operation failed, but according to our calculations it already had a small chance of success. So for the moral and slight physical damage to your health, take compensation in the amount of <Money> cr. And we will make another attempt to free the complex, this time without your involvement.
        GovTextStart=Ranger <Player>! We have a suitable task for you.
        GovTextStart=Not long ago the <Star> system was attacked by dominators. A serious battle took place, in which both sides suffered serious losses. At one point it even seemed that the situation was getting out of control and we needed to start evacuating the government and population as soon as possible, but at the last moment we managed to regroup and push the invader forces out of the system. Because of the chaos, we lost contact with many strategically important locations. We managed to restore it later. The only exception was the communications center located on the planet's volcanic satellite <Planet>. This complex is notable for its power, which not only allows us to maintain channels of communication with even the most remote systems. In addition, the antennas can be reconfigured to interfere with a known frequency. Lack of communication with the complex is an alarming sign. Presumably, it has been taken over by the dominators. The situation is complicated by strong seismic activity on the satellite, so the only possible option is to send robots there. We'd be very grateful if you could help us with that.
        GovTextWin=Congratulations on the win, <Player>! Unfortunately we didn't have a chance to contact you right after the mission, but that's a minor oversight.

        GovTextLoss=You, <Player>, completely failed to satisfy our expectations. How could you lose this battle, with your robot control experience? Now we'll have to spend money on another operation, commanded by a different ranger. And all that time, the tautitan mine will be idle. Every hour of downtime costs millions cr for our economy, and that's not even counting the penalty for delays in our contracts!
        GovTextLoss=We have, however, prudently insured this enterprise, so there should be enough money for the next operation to knock out the Dominators from the asteroid, and for a decent reward for your successor. Even you are entitled to <Money> for your efforts. What? That's not enough for you? Or maybe you blew the operation on purpose for a handout from our "Alliance" opponents? Get out of here immediately, or you'll have to deal with our lawyers!
        GovTextStart=Yes, <Player>, your help will come in handy. The basis of our planet's economy is industry. There is an orbiting station in high orbit, mining minerals from asteroids. Not long ago, a particularly large one was brought to us from deep space. This asteroid turned out to be rich in deposits of tautitanium, known for its strength. So we ordered a new shipment of extraction equipment from the pel... partners. Unfortunately, they sent us dominators under the imitation of modern drilling rigs. We had to urgently evacuate the miners. It must have been the intrigues of our competitors from the "Astromining Alliance". Our lawyers have already started collecting evidence against these scoundrels. CAFIC won't send troops for months, and we can't afford to wait. So we have no choice but to land combat robots on the asteroid. Well, Ranger, are you willing to take command? The Miners' Association won't be indebted.
        GovTextWin=Congratulations, <Player>, you've done a great job. By the way, it turns out that the dominator methods of tautitan mining were much more effective than ours. Thanks to you, we will be able to study them well. And while you were busy freeing our asteroid, tautitan prices on the intergalactic stock exchange went up considerably, which will make up for all the losses from the mining stoppage. On behalf of the Miners' Association, let me give you a <Money> cr.

In turn, the terronoids have fortified themselves in the southeast. We managed to deploy a base in the west. The Dominators were able to set up mining operations, so they have plenty of resources. However, your side is strategically well positioned. Most likely, your opponents will not pay attention to you and will be busy with each other for some time. You should take advantage of this and have time to set up production before you start fighting. Good luck, ranger!
        RobotsWin=Congratulations, <Player>, we had no doubt of your victory. The asteroid is free of dominators, which means nothing will interfere with your tautitan extraction. Surely you've had enough of this piece of rock, it's time to return to the planet with your report.

        GovTextLoss=Black day for science! Because of your ineptitude we had to destroy the complex along with all the employees. We lost a lot of scientists, not to mention research results. The best minds of their generation have fallen as a result of one humanoid's monstrous mistake. I can see by your face that you are just as sad about what happened as we are. I hope you won't have nightmares after this. And if they do, sign up for a session of psychological relaxation, we'll even allocate you <Money> cr  for it.
        GovTextStart=Sit down, <Player>, we have a very responsible task for you. On an island far from civilization, there is a research facility dedicated to the study of the Dominators' remains. This business is sponsored by a network of resaearch stations. The complex itself consists of the main base, responsible directly for the study of the remnants, and several centers involved in the dismantling of the dominators into component parts. Unfortunately, such a risky venture has attracted <clr>kelleroids<clrEnd>, surely in the Ranger Center you was told that they too are a kind of "scientist." Don't look at me like that, ranger, we've taken precautions: we've built impressive fortifications around the central complex, capable of deterring invasion from the outside. However, the kelleroids were more cunning and broke into one of the bases, where they immediately started manufacturing robots. We had to urgently evacuate all personnel to the main base building. After that, dominators attempted to storm the fortifications, but failed. Somehow the other two series found out about the place and landed on the island. We invite you to lead a ground operation to clear the area of enemy forces.
        GovTextWin=Bravo, <Player>! Brilliant victory! Words cannot express how grateful we are for your rescue of our scientists. Now the research complex will be able to resume it's work in normal mode, thanks to the increased amount of materials for the study. The scientific community has already transferred to your account <Money> cr.
        GovTextWin=By the way, would you like to donate some dominator scrap to us? Are you sure you don't want to? All right, all right, let's not take work from our colleagues from the scientific bases.

        RobotsLoss=This is some kind of catastrophe! Do you have any idea what you've done?! Now the Dominators have access to the results of important research, as well as huge reserves of resources, enough to produce a whole army of robots. We'll have to destroy the island along with the complex. Evacuate immediately, aircraft will arrive any minute and will not leave a quark on a quark from this place.
        RobotsStart=You've finally arrived! We managed to hold off the attack, but the situation is close to critical. The kelleroids tried to break into the main base right behind our lines. On the good side, they failed to do this because the security system malfunctioned and froze the base. On the bad side, you'll have to get it back under control.
        RobotsStart=You have a small unit in the east of the complex. Lead it to the base, then proceed to push the dominators off the island. Be careful, there are <clr>terronoids<clrEnd> already deployed nearby.
        RobotsWin=Well done, <Player>! You haven't left the robots a chance. We will immediately begin repairing the damaged structures, as well as strengthening the security of the complex. They are waiting for you in the government with the report.

        GovTextLoss=I knew the rangers were no match for the real CAFIC officers. Yes, it wasn't an easy assignment, but you have experience in combat operations with modular robots, so it says in your file from the Ranger Center.
        GovTextLoss=I can't even imagine how we're going to clear the "Nibelung" of Dominators now. Nevertheless, even for this unfortunate command of our forces, you are entitled to a standard officer's pay of <Money> cr. The money has been transferred to your account, so go away.
        GovTextLoss=I hope you fight better in space than on the surface, otherwise with such woeful defenders we can only hope for the military.
        GovTextStart=<Player>, there is one extremely important matter. The other day we received an alarm from one of the defensive complexes called <clr>"Nibelung" base <clrEnd>. This fortress was constructed over three hundred years ago during the Klissan War. Back then, we didn't know that the Klissans couldn't land on the surface of planets, so we were preparing for a full-scale invasion. The base is located in a channel at a medium distance from the capital. I hope you now understand it's strategic importance. In peacetime, the citadel was not much in demand, so it was used mainly during training exercises. When war with the Dominators began, it was decided to upgrade and increase the garrison. However, a week ago, the base commandant received orders to transfer to another planet, and we did not have time to appoint a new one. And then, out of the blue, the Dominators landed in the area of the fortress, and all three series at once. The garrison was not prepared for such a sudden attack, so most of the territory was lost.
        GovTextStart=We ask you to take command of the remaining forces and return the base to our control. If it will be successful, you will be accorded military honors as well as a generous reward. You will learn all the details on the spot, if you agree, of course.
        GovTextWin=Recognize, <Player> we did not particularly believe in the success of this operation, however, you have shown yourself exceptionally well. Just think, with a modest garrison and a limited supply of resources, you managed to regain complete control of our citadel.
        GovTextWin=It is no exaggeration to say that this feat deserves to go down in the textbooks of military science. I think you should visit our military academy in the capital at your leisure, so to speak, to inspire the young recruits personally for the victories to come. Let's move on to the reward - you are entitled to <Money> cr.
        GovTextWin=I hope the other rangers are at least half as good as you are. Then we have every chance of winning this war.

        RobotsStart=A small area near the pier remains under our control at the moment. The base is under siege - the survived garrison constantly repels attacks from the kelleroids, whose territory lies to the north, and the terronoids to the southeast. In turn, the <clrEnd>blazeroid<clrEnd> forces have occupied most of the fortress.
        RobotsStart=First you should take the time to defend. Then already think about taking better positions and defeating one of the enemy bases. I give you the command of the garrison.
        RobotsWin=Impressive victory, <Player>. Pack up, the hoverplane will take you right to the government building, where they've been waiting for you.

        GovTextLoss=<Player>, we are shocked by what has happened. The aggressor has won, which means that the species living in the reserve are doomed... However, you will still be paid <Money> cr. For trying to fight back, so to speak. Go away, we want nothing more to do with you.
        GovTextStart=Say, <Player>, do you know how reverently our civilization treats nature? <Planet> is one of the youngest Gaalian colonies, only 11 thousand years old. This planet is notable for its rich flora and fauna, which we consider to be the most genuine gift to be preserved for our descendants. This is the reason why there are almost no minerals mined here, there is no heavy industry as such, and only a small part of the planet has been colonized. On the other hand, we have an abundance of protected areas, which in total are home to thousands of endemic species. Dominators have recently invaded one of these reserves. Analysts believe they were attracted by the rich deposits of resources. We cannot simply bomb them, as this would kill many plants and animals and make vast areas uninhabitable. Nature can't defend itself, but you can.
        GovTextStart=If you agree, we will provide you with everything you need to win and get you to the operation immediately.
        GovTextWin=Unbelievable, <Player>, you really did it! We've already sent a crew out to dismantle all the factories and bases. It'll be a while before the reserve gets back to the way it was. In the meantime, we have reported your deed to the Intergalactic Wildlife Rescue Service. They were delighted with your deed, so, in addition to a sense of moral satisfaction, you are entitled to a grant of <Money> cr.

        RobotsStart=The primary task is to clear the reserve of invaders. Unfortunately, we also had to deploy a base and a couple of factories to increase your chances of winning.
        RobotsWin=Good job, <Player>! You were able to deal with the invaders. We have to get you to the government.

        GovTextLoss=Yeah, Ranger, it's been a long time since I've seen such a grandiose failure. Now we'll never know which animal those bones belonged to. Your inexpert command of robots has put an end to the possibility of excavation on our planet. Our Gaalian colleagues were no less upset by the outcome of the operation. However, your defeat demonstrated how weak the planetary defenses were, so we managed to convince the same Gaalians to allocate money to strengthen them. Even you will get a portion of that amount - <Money> cr.
        GovTextLoss=And now get off our planet right away, we don't like loser rangers here.
        GovTextStart=Special mission? We have an important assignment for you. Our planet <Planet> has extremely scarce reserves of minerals, with the exception of peat, which is often found in swampy areas. Needless to say, most of the planetary power industry runs on its combustion? Just the other day in one of the mining pits the ancient fossils of an animal were found. Gaal archaeologists were immediately interested in the find, but somehow the Dominators also got wind of it.
        GovTextStart=<clr>kelleroid<clrEnd> forces managed to get past our orbital defenses and landed right at the dig location. Apparently, they want those relics-why do they need our peat? We have prepared a landing party to clear the area of enemy forces, and you have arrived just in time. If you agree to head the operation, you will receive a handsome reward.
        GovTextStart=What do you think?
        GovTextWin=Tell me, <Player>, does the word "tyrannogobzaur" mean anything to you? Neither to me, and Gaalian archaeologists have classified the remains found in the swamp as such. According to the theory, these animals, which reached 30 meters in height, were the ancestors of modern gobsaurs. Apparently, the planet <Planet> used to be home to a rather large population of these creatures. I would also like to report that in exchange for free access to the fossils, the Gaalian side has shared their energy technology with us. Now we won't have to burn thousands of tons of peat, all thanks to your skills! I have already ordered that you be paid <Money> cr. You deserve much more, but unfortunately, the planetary budget is already scheduled a year in advance, and due to the modernization of the energy sector, there is very little free money left.

        GovTextLoss=How did this happen, <Player>?! You have been defeated. We'll have to think hard about how to get rid of the Dominators, or even the island itself, without attracting too much attention. As for you... Take <Money> cr. for trying to do something and also for keeping quiet. If you blab, however, Dzuhallag will be sure to find out about it and get you at least in the other Arm of the Galaxy.
        GovTextStart=Task you say? We may have a job just for you.
        GovTextStart=Say, <Player>, how do you feel about controlling robots? Can you keep a secret? Then listen up. Our planet is home to the headquarters of Dzuhallag, coordinating agents in this sector of the Galaxy. It is a network of structures located on a cloaked uninhabited island. There is no easy way to get there, and detecting any traces from the spy satellites is impossible. Or so we thought, until the complex was attacked by the Dominators. It's not just the fact that those silly jellybeans run our territory, but they also threaten important operations. Just imagine yourself as a spy who can't get forged documents or important information on his mission in time. It's just unimaginable! However, leading an agent network is very different from commanding combat robots in a direct confrontation. Therefore, we appeal to you as an experienced specialist. Trust me, Dzuhallag won't be in your debt.
        GovTextWin=<Player>, you proved good enough to succeed in freeing the headquarters. You have rightfully earned these <Money> cr. that we earned by honestly blackmailing politicians and looting merchants. Relax, Ranger, it's a joke. Dzuhallag does not engage in such petty nastiness. We just "borrowed" that money from a certain Faeyan bank, hehe.

        RobotsStart=We deployed the base in a fairly inconspicuous place off the road, so they won't pay attention to you for a while. Try to make the most of this advantage.
        RobotsWin=Good, <Player>, the headquarters is under our control again. At first glance, the complex does not look badly damaged, so it will not stand idle for long. It's time for you to go back to the government.

        GovTextLoss=That's right, <Player>, what do you have to say for yourself? Bad luck? Anyway, our detectives would like to ask you a few questions, since they have good reason to suspect you of intentionally destroying evidence. Now put your hand in this box. Do you know the man in this picture? What do you know about supplying drugs to our planet? Did you lose the battle on purpose? Our lie detector shows that you are completely clean. The scoundrel almost slipped out of our hands, and there is a high probability that he will go straight to the spaceport to his ship instead of a prison. Regardless, we will pay you <Money> cr. for formally assisting the security forces.
        GovTextLoss=Goodbye Ranger, we don't want to work with you anymore.
        GovTextStart=<Player>, how do you feel about the possibility of assisting justice? At the moment, there is a high-profile trial of a notorious human pirate nicknamed <clr>"redbeard"<clrEnd> on our planet <Planet>. The case is progressing extremely slowly, the suspect clearly has connections in the government and perhaps even among the people's diplomats. The only thing the investigation has been able to hang on to is the failure to pay taxes. As you can understand, a serious corruption scandal is brewing, and many people don't want their dark deeds to be exposed.
        GovTextStart=We know that this pirate was involved in smuggling drugs to our planet, but he worked through a dozen intermediaries. Presumably, evidence of this can be found on a private island belonging to one of the alleged accomplices. The problem is that as soon as we managed to get a search warrant and arrive there, the security robots activated and began to sink the island along with the structures on it. The criminals must have thought of everything...
        GovTextStart=We can't blow up the island with an orbital strike or send plasmotanks there, since then it's unlikely that any evidence will be saved. Therefore, we are forced to turn to you, as an expert in controlling combat robots. Help us save the island from sinking.
        GovTextWin=Thank you for your brilliant operation, <Player>. Our spies have already found something curious on one of the camouflaged bases. The scale of corruption on the planet <Planet> is greater than anyone anticipated. Definitely a string of high-ranking arrests awaiting us, so you could say you contributed to justice. As for the pirate - he can't get away with at least not paying taxes.
        GovTextWin=Unfortunately, in unraveling this tangle, we can't avoid a diplomatic scandal involving people, but in this case the fight against crime is a priority for us. Let's move on to the reward - you are entitled to <Money> cr. for assisting our security forces.

        RobotsStart=But the good news for you is that the enemy robots belong to two different series of dominators, so our specialist managed to crack the "friend-or-foe" system, so your opponents will not act in unison. However, they will execute their basic algorithms to eliminate the threat that is you, and try to sink the island.
        RobotsStart=All in all, you have a good chance of winning, go for it.
        RobotsWin=Great, <Player>, you haven't let us down. The island is no longer in danger of sinking, so there's plenty of work for our trackers to do. You shouldn't linger here on this island, especially since the government wants to see you.

Even you will get <Money> cr. for your persistence. By the way, if you had succeeded on the battlefield, the amount would have been much higher. This is the end of the good news for you, because those same powerful people have already started searching for the culprit. It's in your best interest to get away from the planet <Planet> as quickly as possible so as not to get caught in the heat of the moment.
        GovTextStart=Yes, ranger, we just needed some help with a case. It so happens that not so long ago the rich persons of our planet had a rather exotic entertainment - sand spike racing. Have you heard about these creatures from the planet Earth? In spite of the fact that in the first place they are used as unpretentious pack animals, they prove themselves rather good in races. Almost every self-respecting businessman has several favorite racehorses. The biggest races are accompanied by a sweepstakes, and as you understand, where large sums of money circulate - there inevitably appear mf... ahem... respected and influential personalities, extremely involved in the whole affair.
        GovTextStart=The main venue for such races is the Hirro island, which has a desert climate perfectly suited to sand spikes. There will be a big competition there the other day, with stakes numbering in the millions cr. More accurately, it was supposed to take place, but the venue suddenly became occupied by dominators. Some nefarious but powerful bookie must be interested in cancelling the event and thus getting all the bets placed back. Even though the event is insured, we still want it to happen on time. The only possible way to resolve this unpleasant situation is to send modular robots to the island. Judging by the dossier from the ranger center, you are just the man to be put in command. Agree, <Player>, you will not be left without reward.
        GovTextWin=Oh, <Player>, you came back to us with good news! Very soon the island will be cleared of the wreckage of the dominators, and the contest will be held on time.

        GovTextLoss=Yes, <Player>, you have managed to aggravate our already difficult situation. Because of the dominators, the planetary budget suffers great losses. At the same time, they can damage the stabilization matrix that keeps the volcano from erupting, and that already threatens the complete destruction of the production complex.
        GovTextLoss=You'd better leave <Planet> as soon as possible. Oh, yes, according to the contract, we have to pay you a completely undeserved <Money> cr. Take your pittance and leave.
        GovTextStart=You're in luck, ranger, we're just looking for a volunteer for one delicate but high-paying assignment. We need to free the Vulcan from the Dominators. Don't look at me like I'm crazy, I'll bring you up to speed. This volcano is not just some natural monument or tourist attraction, but a real production center. <Planet> is known for it's harsh weather conditions, so colonization progressed rather slowly. Over time, we managed to tame nature, including stabilizing that one volcano. After that, we found a new use for it as a very powerful and unpretentious source of energy. Naturally, this created all the conditions for the development of the metallurgical industry, with the main plant located right in the cannon. Everything was going just fine, but recently the territory of the complex was infiltrated by the terronoids. They managed in a short time to take control over production facilities and set up the assembling of combat robots. Besides, we can't be sure that the dominators won't damage the stabilization matrix that keeps the volcano from erupting.
        GovTextStart=Please, <Player>, help us. This volcano is extremely important to our planet, we can't give it up to the enemy.
        GovTextWin=Bravo, <Player>, you did it! The complex is no longer in danger of destruction. We've already sent a repair crew to the site, so it won't be long before production resumes. To your account has already been transferred honestly earned <Money> cr. By the way, would you like to take some souvenir made of volcanic glass as a gift? We have plenty of them.

        RobotsStart=We've managed to set up base on the north landing pad. Unfortunately, we didn't arrive alone: the <clr>kelleroids<clrEnd> landed with us at the same time. However, the main threat doesn't come from them, but from the terronoids, entrenched inside the volcano.
        RobotsStart=You won't have much resources, so try to use them wisely.
        RobotsWin=<Player>, I see you've already finished dealing with the dominators. Thanks to you, Vulcan is safe again.
        RobotsWin=Jump to the hovercraft, I'll take Vaz back to the government, where they will gladly listen to your victory report.

        GovTextLoss=Ranger, you lost the island! It is frightening to imagine what now awaits the felgotross population. For such mediocre command you should have been sent somewhere to uranium mines, but you fought to the end, so we can't do that according to the terms of the contract. Moreover, we will even pay you <Money> cr. Take them and get out before the inhabitants of our planet find out that you are the one to blame for what happened. If they find out, we cannot guarantee your safety.
        GovTextStart=Ranger <Player>, we have a mission for you. A special one. Of extreme importance. Perhaps we should go in from afar and give you a brief history of our planet.
        GovTextStart=Since the twenty-fourth century, Pelengs have been actively sending so-called "sleeper" ships. They carried pelengs immersed in anabiosis, as well as provisions and equipment, calculated for decades of flight, so that upon arrival, the "awakened" colonists could immediately begin to build a settlement and establish communications with the metropolis - Rakhish. How do I know all this? You are profoundly mistaken if you think you are being enlightened by a common lyakusha. As a matter of fact, I did my PhD on early space exploration by pelengs at the Galactic Institute for Interracial Observation.
        GovTextStart=Well, back to our point. One of these sleeper ships was sent here to <Planet>. The flight was successful, but on the approach stage a small asteroid hit it, caught by the planet's gravitational field. As a result of the strike, most of the colonizer ship's systems were critically damaged, and it crashed to the planet. By some miracle, or no other way, most of the pelengs survived, but almost all of the equipment and provisions were lost. Naturally, after that, no development of the colony was out of the question. On Rakhish, all the colonists were considered dead and the planet was considered uninhabitable. At first, our race struggled to survive in the unaccustomed wild conditions, so it inevitably degenerated. However, some of the knowledge available at that time was saved, so the surviving scientists were elevated almost to the rank of priests, whose knowledge and skills were perceived as magic by ordinary pelengs. It is because of this that Chhashes and Lyakushes are equally honored on our planet.
        GovTextStart=And so our world passed from age to age, until one single peleng appeared... And that peleng was the Supreme Lyakusha Chaygazhan. Ever heard of him? No? Well, I consider it my duty to inform you about such a significant personality in our history.
        GovTextStart=Chaigazkhan was born in a farmers' settlement - don't be surprised, the peelers had to get used to hard work too, because there were no shrakans around - and he lived quietly till his teenage years, until this settlement was attacked... It was a raid of one Lyakusha's gang. As a result Chaygazkhan's parents were killed. He soon grew up, and due to his cunning and uncommon wit, he became Lyakusha and the leader not only of his settlement, but also of his surroundings. Then he decided to take revenge on his offender. Naturally, his current strength would not be enough for this, and he began to assemble the gang with both diplomacy and cunning, as well as brute force. A few years later he had many settlements on the planet under his control, and an almost small army gathered under his command. And he went up against his old enemy, wanting revenge. Then that Lyakusha ruled in the largest settlement on the planet, near the site of the colonial shipwreck. A grand battle ensued - two equal armies converged in a deadly battle in the middle of the swamp. Despite some numerical and technological disadvantage, Chaygazkhan's army won the battle at the expense of greater discipline. Lyakusha was defeated, and Chaygazkhan became the de facto ruler of the entire planet. Thus, somewhat accidentally, his empire was born. Thanks to its emergence, Pelengs stopped the endless internecine warfare and in just a few decades were able to return to their previous level of development, after which they established a connection with Rakhish, where they clearly did not expect such a scenario.
        GovTextStart=You might want to ask: What does Chaygazkhan have to do with it? And I will answer that before the decisive battle with Lyakusha, the ruler of the city, Chaygazkhan's army passed along the coast. And there warriors saw an incredibly rare bird, the pink felgotross, which migrates from north to south, covering a huge distance over the ocean. The population of this species is only in the hundreds, so the chances of seeing this bird were negligible. Naturally, the appearance of felgotrosses was and still is considered to be a happy omen. And, as I have already told you, Chaygazkhan won that battle. Decades later, when we once again began to plough the seas, a faraway island was found where these birds rest, and some even nest. Naturally, the descendants of the Great Chaygazkhan ordered to make this island a sacred place, in order to preserve the memory of the birds who brought the news of the coming victory on their wings.
        GovTextStart=And then, recently, blazeroids landed on this territory. Despite desperate resistance from our forces, the island came under enemy control. The Dominators are rampaging around the island, driving felgotrosses from their nesting grounds to build factories and mine resources. We cannot allow them to destroy our sacred place. It is written in your dossier that you are quite good with combat robots, so we suggest you liberate our island. If successful, you will be paid a handsome cash reward.
        GovTextWin=Unbelievable, <Player>, the island is under our control again! Just like Chaygazkhan himself, you have won a great victory over the enemy. Now nothing will threaten the felgotross population. Allow me to thank you on behalf of all inhabitants of the planet <Planet> and present you with a check for the sum of <Money> cr.

        RobotsStart= You get a base and enough resources to produce a decent army of robots. The government has high expectations of you, and you'd better live up to them.
        RobotsWin=The enemy is defeated! <Player>, you are our savior! Felgotrosses can't thank you, but we can.

        GovTextLoss=Yes, <Player>, you've done a "good" job. Dominators, of course, did not get access to the archive, but at the same time, you did not manage to go unnoticed. The explosion was visible from orbit, so now we have to figure out how to explain it to the citizens. I thought of it, we will give an interview to the media about how we helped our Coalition allies in the development and testing of a new environmentally friendly bomb.
        GovTextLoss=Are you still here? We are ready to pay you <Money> cr. for buying enough time to activate the complex's self-destruct mechanism. Yes, the amount is small, but you have not completed the task. You can leave the government building, we have no desire to do business with you.
        GovTextStart=Do you want a mission? We have one important problem, but you have to be good enough to take it on.
        GovTextStart=Surely in the lessons of intergalactic history you were told that all the knowledge accumulated by the Gaalian civilization is stored in the memory of the Convent Masters - the highest managers of our society. From time to time, some of this invaluable information is backed up, after which it is sent for storage in secret archives located on different planets. A very limited number of gaalians know about whereabouts of these archives, since many of them would like to use this information for their own selfish interests.
        GovTextStart=One of these backup storages is located here on the planet <Planet>. The trouble is that the Dominators have recently found out about him. It's scary to even imagine how the course of the war could change if they get access to the information stored there. It is in our interests to get rid of mechanical aggressors without anyone noticing. The only suitable way for this is a ground operation. But, unfortunately, there is no one to lead it. This is where your skills in controlling combat robots will come in handy. If you agree, we will immediately teleport you to the complex.
        GovTextWin=Congratulations on your victory, ranger, thanks to you, the dominators did not get the valuable information stored in the archive. And most importantly, no one suspected what happened on the island. Unfortunately, the complex will still have to be mothballed, and the storage media will have to be moved to another place. As for the reward - well-deserved <Money> cr. already transferred to your personal account.

        RobotsStart=<Player>, answer! I see that you are in order, which means that the teleportation was successful. Let's get to the point:
        RobotsStart=We transfer to your subordination the base located in the center of the complex, where the enemy has not yet managed to reach. The Kelleroids were the first to arrive on the island, so they managed to gain a foothold inside the archive. However, two other series of dominators also did not stand aside. The Blazeroids occupied the southern part of the island, turning it into a fortified area. At the moment, they are trying to recapture the main hall from the Kelleroids. The terronoids landed last, pushing the Kelleroids from the east far to the north.
        RobotsStart=Finally, remember: in case of your defeat, the archive's self-destruct system will be activated, and the entire island will explode in a matter of minutes. In order not to perish with him, use the same teleportation device with which you got here. That's all, proceed to eliminate the enemy forces.
        RobotsWin=Great, <Player>, the archive is back under our control. Do not linger here, use the teleport and report the success of the operation to the government.

        GovTextLoss=Ah, it's you, <Player>. Aren't you ashamed after such a crushing defeat? You have managed to lose, having under the command of an elite squad of robots, created specifically for this mission. In a good way, you should be imprisoned and your property seized to pay a penalty in favor of "Makhpella-Oskt Limited", but we can't do this due to the convention for the protection of the rights of rangers signed by the Galactic Council. Now get out of the government building immediately, or better yet, get out of the planet <Planet>.
        GovTextStart=Ranger <Player>, let me ask you, how do you feel about drinking the legendary alcoholic drink "Makhpella dark"? Purely positive? Well, not at all surprised. And I think that trillions of representatives of the Coalition races will be in solidarity with you. Did you know that the water for this famous beer is taken from the purest sources of several planets, including our own? Not? Not surprising. However, such a policy of "Makhpella-Oskt Limited" is quite understandable - they strive to make their famous drink only better in taste, while retaining an element of that very "secret ingredient". So, we have one problem. The fact is that one of the largest water intake complexes was captured by the dominators. I suppose that they needed water to cool the machines at their own production facilities to create new modules. We cannot allow a disruption in supplies, otherwise "Makhpella-Oskt" will make us bankrupt. We guarantee you a good monetary reward for this mission, if successful, of course. Do you agree?
        GovTextWin=And here is our winner! Come on, <Player>, we've been waiting for you. The invaders are defeated, and the water will be delivered on time, and all this is your merit. Let me give you a check for <Money> cr. Would you like to star in a beer commercial for the last time? We also came up with a slogan for you - <clr>"Makhpella dark is the key to the success of any ranger"<clrEnd>. Are you sure you don't want to? Okay, let's not insist, you helped us out a lot anyway.

        RobotsStart=As you can see, our landing force managed to capture a titanium plant in the south of the island. We transfer under your control a detachment of experimental universal robots, constructed specifically for this mission.
        RobotsStart=Now dominator forces on the island are approximately equal in strength, but this is only for now. Sooner or later, neutral bases will be captured, and then we will completely lose control of the complex.
        RobotsStart=Try not to drag out the fight, and also save as many robots as possible. You will not have neither production base nor large supply of resources.

        GovTextLoss=Not only did you allow the Dominators to take over the island, and therefore all the fossils that they can use in the war with us, but also added a headache to me in the form of angry letters from the entire Scientific Community! It's a pity that I had to trust such a... weak ranger. From now on, you are an uninvited guest on our planet.
        GovTextStart=Yes, <Player>, you have a very important and responsible task.
        GovTextStart=In the "backyard" of one of the polar seas, there is a small island. In ancient times, when the planet <Planet> was just being explored, it, like several neighboring ones, began erupting local volcanoes. The sun was out of sight for several months. Yes, our ancestors had a hard time. Well, then this cataclysm ended as suddenly as it began, so we quickly lost interest in that region.
        GovTextStart=But not so long ago, one of the famous scientist and extreme traveler Feo-Door Konokh, while traveling around the world in our Arctic, stumbled upon one of these islands. It would have been forgotten if he hadn't thought of taking samples of hardened lava from the slope of this long-extinct volcano. It turned out that the lava contains some kind of ultra-rare mineral, and the scientists demanded from us the construction of a whole scientific complex, with a full-fledged port, and what a port. Tens of millions cr had to be invested in this project.
        GovTextStart=And everything would be fine, but dominators appeared! As you might guess, they were interested in the complex, from which we had to urgently evacuate scientists. Fortunately, they managed to escape on one of the Strela-type boats. According to reports from our intelligence, the aggressors are also interested in the minerals contained in this lava.
        GovTextStart=In general, we have a business proposal: you free the island from the dominators, returning to us our hard-earned money invested in the complex, and freeing us from the need to read piles of angry letters from all over our Arm of the Galaxy every day, and we transfer control over the landing group that captured the peak to you plus a hefty cash prize. Deal?
        GovTextWin=Please accept my sincere congratulations, <Player>! The island is liberated, which means I won't have to fend off angry messages written by scientists from all over the Coalition. Thank you very much!

        RobotsStart=<clr>Blazeroids<clrEnd> successfully occupied both ports, setting up their main base in the northwestern harbor with their gunship. <clr>Kelleroids<clrEnd> occupied the science lab, where they were able to set up a full-fledged robot production, while the <clr>terronoids<clrEnd> occupied the information processing center located close to the center of the island.

        GovTextLoss=So... what do we do now? We had high hopes for you, but you did not justify them at all. Apparently you're out of the habit of controlling robots, otherwise I can't explain how you managed to lose in such a good position. No, we're not interested in your excuses. As for the platform... the entire complex would have to be destroyed before the Dominators finally established themselves deep within it. Because of you, we have lost our main production, which means that now we will not be able to build either military or merchant ships. We can say that you ruined the economy of our planet. Go away, ranger, I don't want to see you again.
        GovTextLoss=What?! What's the payout? They're completely crazy, aren't they? Imagine, according to these laws, you are still entitled to the amount of <Money> cr. as a percentage of the value of the scrap metal that we calculated can collect after the destruction of all the buildings of the island by bombardment! This is madness! Laws... Okay, take your money, and get out of sight.
        GovTextStart=There is a task - we need to save our main production facilities from the main enemies, well, those from whom you are fighting off there, in space. Yes, the interplanetary space of the <Star> system is now free from dominators, but here, on our planet, there are still pockets of resistance. One such place is a large industrial complex where almost everything is made, from machinery to spaceships. For protection purposes, most of the factory is under the ocean floor. However, there are also structures on the surface. So, among the territories occupied by the dominators was the island "Imperial", where one of the assembly platforms associated with the complex is located. Now the enemy controls most of its surface and actively collects the resources available there, which does not suit us at all. We could just bomb them, but in this case, all the structures on the island will be destroyed. In addition, the underground part of the complex will certainly suffer, as the blast wave will damage the protective structures.
        GovTextStart=There is only one solution - to carry out a ground operation to clean up the area using modular robots, for which, in fact, we need you, <Player>. This is a serious and responsible matter, and we entrust it to you, as we have heard a lot about your past victories in ground battles. Are you already thinking about a reward? Well, of course, just defeat the enemies first.
        GovTextWin=Our industry is safe, thanks in large part to your efforts, <Player>. The dominators have been expelled from the island, so all that remains is to restore the damaged structures, and, of course, pay the reward amount - <Money> cr. - this money has already been transferred to your account. You can buy something from our store. By the way, almost all goods from there are produced in the same complex, so you must understand the significance of the operation.

According to protocol, we must evacuate the strategist, that is, you. From myself I will add that you are a very mediocre strategist. A mission of paramount importance is under threat, and we almost lost it!
        RobotsStart=I give general information. We've installed a standard capacity base and a titanium factory, as well as defensive turrets, but we're running out of resources. Electronics are especially bad, so save. But there are plenty of energy batteries - you won't freeze.
        RobotsStart=The Dominators turned out to be serious opponents, their positions are well fortified, and there are a lot of resources, so the battle can drag on. The Kelleroids, having completely defeated the Blazeroids, captured the assembly platform of various nodes and gained access to a large amount of resources. They tried to penetrate deep into the complex, underground, but there was a control system failure, which led to the explosion of their base, but they still had resources, so the construction of a new base was not long in coming. It will take some time for the final fixing of the problems, so the construction of robots has only just begun. The terronoids have long been entrenched in the mountains to the southeast of our base, and they also seem to be breaking in deeper. They began to multiply as soon as they became stronger and had already managed to capture a number of factories in the east. Heavy battles are ahead, you are required to stay awake and stubbornly push the enemies off the island.
        RobotsWin=Congratulations on your victory - the complex has been saved from the invaders. It remains only to deliver you to the government, where you will receive a well-deserved reward. Or do you want to linger here in cold?

        GovTextLoss=Yes, ranger, you single-handedly managed to spoil such an important project and nullify all efforts to study the natives. <color=0,50,200>Dominators</color> rampage on the islands and quickly build new fortifications. To deal with them, we will have to involve the army and the space fleet. Do you have any idea what those costs are? In a good way, you should be sent to the tribunal, but instead we are forced to pay you <Money> cr. according to the stupid "terms of the contract." Poor natives, they didn't deserve such a fate...
        GovTextStart=Come on in, there's a job for you. We suggest you go to a remote tropical island located in the Meliasian archipelago in the middle of the ocean. But first, let me tell you the story of this unusual place.
        GovTextStart=Let me tell you about a recent global discovery. How well do you know the history of human astronautics, especially the history of early human exploration of deep space? Have you read about the war with bots? It all started in the middle<color=0,50,200>XXII</color> century, when four large, by the standards of those times, spaceships were sent to colonize habitable planets. The expedition that was sent to our system was about to collapse. The crew discovered signs of intelligent life on the planet - our infrastructure of those times, and decided to stay in orbit for a while to establish contact and let them know that their intentions were peaceful. But while they were waiting, the bots arrived - our common enemy of that time. The bots knocked out their ship and it fell into the ocean.
        GovTextStart=“None of the crew survived” - this was stated both in the news and in all official documents. However, it turned out that this was not the case. Some of the people survived, having managed to evacuate into a special capsule, which was on board just in case. When the capsule fell into the water, according to the main version, it drowned due to damage and rolled into an underwater cave. Fortunately, the capsule contained a supply of food, medical supplies, and scuba gears. Thanks to this, people soon got out of there and reached the islands.
        GovTextStart=The further survival of people was possible because among the medicines there were special mutagens and immunomodulators that allowed them to eat the local marine life and not die from allergies. But with technology, electronics and storage media, things were very bad - almost all the gadgets that they managed to take into the capsule soon failed. And after only a few centuries, the former people became incredibly wild! Mutated from not entirely harmless drugs and family ties, having lost most of their knowledge, especially scientific and technical, they began to live in a tribal system. They fought for territory with homemade spears and bows, wore clothes made of leaves, and even tried to conjure. Imagine - they prayed to the remains of the ship found in the ocean!
        GovTextStart=These tribes were discovered recently, but the scientific expedition was disrupted by a sudden visit of <color=0,50,200>dominators</color>. The natives - you can already call them that - did not have time to evacuate, and they are still hiding somewhere there. Help us to carefully get rid of the iron invaders - while there is someone to study! A solid award from three scientific foundations at once is guaranteed.
        GovTextWin=On behalf of the government of the planet <Planet>, as well as the galactic scientific community, we congratulate you on the success of this mission, Ranger <Player>! The total reward payments from the funds <color=0,50,200>Recreating the history of the galaxy</color>, <color=0,50,200>Human evolution studies</color> and <color=0,50,200>Search for isolated tribes</color> amounted to <Money>cr. This money has already been transferred to your account. Let them do you good.
        GovTextWin=This discovery will soon become sensational news. However, for now, we will have to wait - to establish full-fledged contact with the tribes and stop the bloodshed by humane methods is not an easy task, it takes time. See you, ranger, we will always be glad to see you on our planet <Planet>.

        RobotsLoss=Do you feel someone's presence? A look at the back of your head? It seems that the late Fierce Max-Black-Spear is not happy with you! You had territory, and robots, and our hopes ... What a ranger, a complete shame. In short, march to transport!
        RobotsStart=Everything turned out worse than we could have imagined. <color=0,50,200>Dominators</color> found a lot of valuable resources here - there is such an oceanic subsoil here, and built a bunch of different structures. There was nothing left of the huts that were here, of course. However, there are other clusters of islands nearby, and there may be living savages sitting under the rocks next to you! And in order to protect them, it is necessary to destroy the enemy.
        RobotsStart=The base we have occupied cannot boast of a favorable strategic location or good defense. However, do not lose heart - the island on which it is located was once controlled by a strong and courageous leader - Ferocious Max-Black-Spear, who mercilessly killed everyone who encroached on this piece of land! And the neighboring tribes, even united, could not defeat the leader and his warriors. This and other legends about him were among the first information we received upon contact with the local tribe.
        RobotsStart=Yes, things have changed a lot here. Until recently, between these islands, savages ran along log bridges, fighting on huge hammers, and arrows whistled in the air. Now the bridges here are made of steel, and only machines go into battle. Well, don't let us down, <Player>.
        RobotsWin=What an onslaught - <color=0,50,200>dominators</color> were just horrified! You really saved everyone. Unfortunately, your clearance level does not allow you to contact the natives, but you are already waiting for congratulations in the government building.

        GovTextLoss=For the first time in ten years, I'm really angry! Guess who I'm so mad at? I won't trust the Rangers again in my life! Now we have to say goodbye to the estate - the authorities have already initiated the process of confiscation of property, and tourists and casual visitors are hastily evacuated. Even compensation in <Money> cr. pay, you know at whose expense. You are our precious tourist! Get out of here, leave me alone.
        GovTextStart=Of course, you don't know what it's like to own a vast private area. And really huge! The total area of the estate is 42.3 thousand square kilometers, of which one third is occupied by the lake. And all this in some ridiculous hundred kilometers from the capital. Strictly speaking, the lake contains many islands and is more like a swamp. Actually, this was one of the reasons why I was able to get this territory for my own use. Despite the fact that my income only grew, it became a burden for me to support all this. No, don't think that I'm tired of spending money on hosting guests or tending gardens. The fact is that I was ordered to increase the cost of protecting the territory five times.
        GovTextStart=Because of the swampiness, the territory of the lake is often shrouded in fog, and recently rumors have appeared in the news about ghosts that can supposedly be found there. Immediately there were those who wanted to see the ghosts with their own eyes, so the influx of tourists to hotels near the lake increased. At first I did not believe that there really was someone in the fog, until I was convinced of this myself. Alas, the military disappointed me by saying that <clr>dominators<clrEnd> started up in my estate, right in the wetland area. More precisely, there are some suspicions of the presence of enemy intelligence. Unfortunately, thick fog interferes with surveillance devices, so I was required to increase security many times over. If my worst fears are confirmed, and they really turn out to be <clr>dominators<clrEnd>, the blockheads of the military will destroy my entire territory, not to mention that the zone will be closed to tourists.
        GovTextStart=I'm not going to just put up with it. Thanks to connections in different societies, I bought modular robots and even a base for their production in some places. It remains only to deliver it to the right place under the guise of building materials, if the patrols spot the enemy. I suggest you go together - our side will look for enemies, and you will eliminate them. You know how to control robots, <Player>, don't you? Good. I'll have to make sure the military doesn't find out about our little special operation, I'll take care of that. Do not forget that you will be rewarded for your work. If you refuse, I will find another strategist.
        GovTextWin=Here you are, <Player>. Everything is just fine - cottages for lovers of a creepy atmosphere are already being built on the site of dismantled factories and bases. By the way, would you like to rent one? Oh yes, I understand - rangers have an eternal lack of time. So, the reward - <Money> cr. has been transferred to your account. Fine? Well, I'm sorry, I'm already on the verge of ruin. I haven't spent as much in a year as I did in the last month. Oops, a candy fell out of your pocket...

        RobotsLoss=How did it happen? Well, how? A total disappointment. Seems like a bad week. Or a month. Or maybe even a year. Dominators dance, and I'm ready to cry. They can even arrest me now, do you understand?!
        RobotsStart=So what's wrong again? Ah, these freelance techs, degradont foreheads, damn them, failed the base setup for the fourth time! My nerves gave out, and I ordered a whole floating platform. Now everything is definitely working.
        RobotsStart=So, we have established the reason for the appearance of these "ghosts" - this is just a side effect of the holographic masking of dominators in fog. If you wanted to see them in person, then I hasten to disappoint - the fog has already subsided, and the enemy has nothing more to hide.
        RobotsStart=As soon as we found them, <color=0,50,200>dominator</color> activity increased dramatically. The kelleroids successfully teleported a pile of rubbish to the eastern island, from which a whole fort with a base was soon built, and the blazeroids managed with difficulty to transfer only one, but powerful robot. I advise you to destroy him as soon as possible, before he gets where he should not. Yes, right now. And don't waste your time - just deal with the kelleroids before they get comfortable. That's all, get started!
        RobotsWin=Exemplary cleaning - everything went like clockwork! Remember: we were building a horror theme park, we were fighting not with dominators, but with armored rats, and the explosions were due to a transport accident with building materials. If you understood everything, I am waiting for you at a party, and then in the capital. The reward has already been prepared.

        GovTextLoss=<Player>, how could you lose? The economy of <Planet> is closely tied to human markets, and due to the fact that you failed the task, the conclusion of new contracts is in question. We have no time left before the arrival of the crown prince, so the press will soon find out about the dominators rampaging on his personal island.
        GovTextLoss=However, I probably got excited. Here, take these <Money> cr. for at least trying to help us. Still, the operation was very difficult, you deserved at least this money. However, we are unlikely to contact you in the future.
        GovTextStart=Not so long ago, our planet was liberated from the dominators. However, separate enemy groups are still active on the surface of <Planet>. The other day we learned that one of these unfinished units is located on the personal island of the human crown prince. Do not be surprised, the past government really decided to make such a gift to improve relations with the ruling dynasty of one of the human planets. Once a year, members of the royal family come to rest on this island, and if it turns out that there are dominators there, we are in for a diplomatic scandal.
        GovTextStart=In this regard, we urgently need a commander who can quickly clear the area from enemy robots. Our strategists even have a plan for such a case, code-named "Sandstorm". Help us, <Player>, before the public finds out. The task is difficult, but highly paid.
        GovTextWin=Good to see you, <Player>! The Dominators were knocked out of the island, and most importantly, no one suspected anything due to the fact that the special operation took place at night. There is still a little time before the arrival of the crown prince, so we will have time to dismantle all the factories. You have no idea how important good relationships with people are to our economy. Let me give you a check for <Money> cr. for a well done job.

        RobotsLoss=The landing party has been defeated! How could you control the robots so recklessly? I see that it was unusual for you to act in such conditions, but we helped you as best we could.
        RobotsLoss=Return to the government building immediately.
        RobotsStart=Thank you for agreeing to help us, ranger. Let me fill you in on the operation plan:
        RobotsStart=During the landing, our forces managed to occupy a titanium plant in the north and a power plant in the west. Unfortunately, the strategists underestimated the presence of the enemy on the island, so the northern detachment was trapped.
        RobotsStart=Your first priority is to connect both units. To do this, our analysts advise you to take control of the plasma laboratory, located next to the western group of robots. Its location will allow you to fend off superior enemy forces, since you are given enough resources to build defensive turrets. If the dominators decide to move towards your titanium plant - <clr>find a way to stop them.<clrEnd> For example, fire from behind the rocks. For our part, we will try to provide you with timely reinforcements.
        RobotsStart=And finally - try to save your <clr>repair robots<clrEnd>, they will make it easier to assault enemy positions.
        RobotsWin=You win, ranger. Nice work!
        RobotsWin=Now is the time to report to the government. We need to get you off the island before dawn.

        GovTextLoss=Sorry, you were unable to regain control of the lab, <Player>. No wonder our forecasters did not believe in the success of the operation. Unfortunately, we will have to completely destroy the complex so that the results of the research do not get to the dominators. However, even such an unfavorable set of circumstances was foreseen, so we agreed in advance with CAFIC to keep a couple of depth charges in storage. After such a purchase, we even have a consolation reward for you - <Money> cr. But if you were successful on the battlefield, this amount would be much more... the cost of a pair of depth charges.
        GovTextStart=Yes, <Player>, your help would be most welcome. Deep below the surface of <Planet> is a secret laboratory for the study of anomalous particles. The experiments carried out in it can potentially lead to discoveries in many areas, but above all, we are counting on the creation of new types of weapons. Unfortunately, during the occupation of our planet, the personnel had to preserve the underground base, as there was a risk that the Dominators would find out about it and try to take possession of the research results.
        GovTextStart=As it turned out, our fears were not in vain - recently, security sensors detected an intrusion into the complex. The metal aggressors have been breaking through to the base for a long time with the help of their earthmoving machines, and have recently reached their goal. The laboratory is of great strategic importance not only for our planet, but for all Faeyan science, so we cannot simply destroy it. But it is also impossible to give the results of research to the enemy. Therefore, the commander of the planetary defense forces decided to deliver modular robots there in order to recapture the enemy base. The trouble is that we do not have a suitable candidate who could be trusted in such an important matter. You are perfect for this job. We know how much money rangers love, so we guarantee you a solid payout if you succeed. What could be better? Agree.
        GovTextWin=Oh, here's the <Player>. We have already been informed of the successful completion of the operation. I confess that your chances of success were not very high, but you were able to defeat the enemy even in such non-standard conditions. For the impeccable execution of such an important task, you are entitled to a reward - <Money> cr. It's a pleasure to do business with you. Feel free to contact us for new missions.

        RobotsLoss=Don't forget to visit the government building. You have a conversation, albeit not the most pleasant.
        RobotsStart=<Player>, how do you hear it?
        RobotsStart=Excellent, connection established. We managed to use one of the reserve bases, we are transferring it, and at the same time several combat robots to your submission. As you can see, the use of earth-moving machines by the enemy did not remain without consequences - in some places the ceiling collapsed, so that part of the corridors was blocked by rubble. All three series of dominators are present in the lab, so be careful, because they can attack you from several directions.
        RobotsStart=That's all, you can start fighting.
        RobotsWin=Ranger, you have won! Great news!
        RobotsWin=The government already knows about your triumph, so be sure to check them out. A well-deserved reward awaits you.

        GovTextLoss=Yeah, your tactical abilities were clearly overrated. Sadly, you were unable to complete the task. The command is afraid that now the dominators can move their command center to another place, which means that sabotage will continue all this time. As for the promised reward - you are only entitled to <Money> cr. Although the operation ended in failure, you still tried, albeit unsuccessfully.
        GovTextStart=Ranger <Player>, we have heard disturbing rumors that <clr>terronoid <clrEnd> sabotage groups are operating on the planet <Planet>. Our intelligence had to work hard, but as a result, we managed to calculate the location of their command center, located on an artificial island in the open sea. The command of the planetary defense forces believes that it is from there that the actions of the enemy forces conducting subversive activities are coordinated. Naturally, this information is not disclosed to the population in order to avoid panic.
        GovTextStart=Now, we could quietly get rid of their command center by sending in a few modular robots. This is a very serious and responsible task, which we cannot entrust to the first person we meet. According to your dossier, which we requested from the ranger center network immediately after your ship landed on <Planet>, it is said that you have won many victories in planetary battles. Therefore, you are the ideal candidate for the operation. Agree, we will not leave you without a reward.
        GovTextWin=<Player>, glad to see you again! The inhabitants of the planet <Planet> can sleep peacefully, and all thanks to you. Left without their command center, the Dominators are unlikely to be able to resist our forces of law and order. Here is your <Money> cr reward. - as agreed. It was nice to work with a competent ranger and not some rogue.

        RobotsStart=We managed to deliver one combat and a couple of repair robots, as well as several turrets, to the territory. The main task is to find and destroy the command center. Believe me, you won't confuse <clr> with anything <clrEnd>. Be careful, there may be <clr>decoys<clrEnd> on the island.

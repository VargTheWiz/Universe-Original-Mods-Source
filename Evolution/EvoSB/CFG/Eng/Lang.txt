            SBAfterOk=You've made a wise purchase. We've delivered <SatName> to your ship.<br>Now you have to find an unpopulated planet, land there and plant the probe. You can then go about your business. The probe may take many months to survey a planet -- a process that can be expedited by putting several probes on the orbit.
            SBInfo=Research probes are widely used to survey unpopulated planets. Please refer to our briefing for the specifics. Now, let's get straight to the point.

            SBInfoAfterInstruction=Well, now that you have become more aware of the researcher's work, would you like to purchase a probe from us in order to quickly begin an exciting search?
            SBInfoNo=In general: We are forced to deny your request. Please complete our probe control training.
            SBInfoOk=In general: We are ready to sell you the probe.
            SBInstruction1=<clr>General:<clrEnd> Research probes have been used for many centuries to survey the surfaces of unpopulated and undeveloped planets. Each probe is designed to work with specific terrain types, which determines its speed and efficiency. A probe's output is typically measured in millions of square kilometers relative to oceanic surface, land and mountainous terrain it can cover per day.
            SBInstruction2=<clr>Probe control:<clrEnd> When surveying unpopulated planets, several probes can be controlled at a time. The exact number hinges on the operator's technical control. Research stations are prohibited from selling probes to those who haven't yet learned all the elements of operating such valuable equipment. This decree is grounded in concern for the native life forms and integrity of their natural development. We mustn't allow heaps of garbage flying on the orbit of undeveloped planets.
            SBInstruction3=<clr>Operating instructions:<clrEnd> After landing on an unpopulated planet, open your explorer's map, take a probe and select its flight trajectory from the available options on the map. Take note of the number of days left until the survey is complete. Planting several probes will allow you to survey the planet faster. Pay close attention to the probe's specs. For example, if the probe cannot survey oceans, it makes no sense planting it on an oceanic planet. Your probes' activity will be updated regularly on the information panel. You can fly about your business, leaving the probes to do their work and send updates on the discovered goods and equipment. Upon returning to the planet, you can pick up the discovered objects, remove the probes from orbit and fly some place else.
            SBInstruction4=<clr>Rights to research:<clrEnd> All the objects found by your probes are yours by law. Our probes are programmed to survey for objects created by highly developed civilizations. Please note that we cannot prevent unsanctioned landings and crashes which may lead to contamination of the environment. Some of the unpopulated planets are home to undeveloped life forms. They have a future of their own to discover, and it is your duty to clean up their planets' surface from the products of our civilizations. A misplaced barrel of fuel mustn't become the cause of another species' demise!
            SBInstruction5=We strongly recommend that you save this information, <Player>.

As for the micromodule, our <2> failed to save it. Condolences.<3>

        242=Remember that getting the job done requires <clr>nodes<clrEnd> for us right here. We can take them from your cargo bay, or at the storage, but not from your node-account.

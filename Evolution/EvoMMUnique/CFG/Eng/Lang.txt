Relict radiation, continuously produced in hyperspace, explains the physical processes occurring inside hyper-bubbles, the research of which made it possible to reduce the mass of missile warheads, thereby increasing the speed of missiles. Upon contact with a target, gravitational dispersion tears space in the impact area, causing additional damage, and because of the instability of gravity in this area - the matter tends to stay in place, which leads to a significant slowing of the target.
